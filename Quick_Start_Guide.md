# Quick Start Guide

# Safe Mode (In Windows 10) 
Safe mode allows your Windows 10 system to boot into a state in which the drivers that are activated are limited and program functionality is at a minimum. This can be used if the computer won’t start under normal circumstances as a troubleshooting step. It can also be used to remove viruses from your system. 

If you are a veteran from Windows 7 or below and are wondering why you can’t press F8 at the Windows startup screen to activate safe mode, proceed to the section labeled “Enable Safe Mode Key” in order to reenable this feature if this was your preferred method. It will reenable that functionality.

## Safe Mode Types

### Safe Mode (Regular) 

The standard Safe Mode that has the most limited functionality but all normal desktop visuals.  


### Safe Mode With Networking 

This version of Safe Mode allows you to still access your network and network-connected devices, such as cloud drives or other technologies.

### Safe Mode With Command Prompt 

The barest version of Safe Mode which doesn’t even load the visuals and instead simply gives you a command prompt to run commands. Most commonly used if graphics drivers are failing at the highest levels or the user wishes to minimize system usage.

## Safe Mode Automatic Method

### Please note that the ability to enter this mode will likely be determined by the speed of your hard drive. If it is an HDD (Hard Disk Drive), then this method should be simple. If it is an SSD, it may be hard to get the timings right and it may be simpler to use other methods. 

1: Ensure your computer is off. 

2: When the Windows 10 Logo appears, hold down the power button until the system turns off. Do this 2 more times (3 total times). 

3: Turn on your PC for the 4th time and it should now begin automatic repair. Wait for Windows to diagnose your PC. 

4: A new menu called “Startup Repair” will open. Select “Advanced Options”.

## Safe Mode At Startup

### Accessing Safe Mode at startup means accessing Safe Mode at system startup as opposed to logging in and using the easier Windows 10 methods. Unfortunately, Windows 10 does not have a built-in functionality to allow you to enter the state under normal circumstances and this must be done beforehand to allow its use.

## Step 1: Enable Safe Mode Key

1: Open Command Prompt by navigating down to the search bar or the Windows button.

*Figure 24. An image indicating to use the search bar or the windows button via red arrows. Image By: Steven Grevera* 

2: Type “CMD” into the search bar

*Figure 25. An image showing "CMD" typed into the search bar. (Image By: Steven Grevera* 

3: Hover your mouse over to the program name and then right-click it with your mouse. Select “Run as administrator.”

*Figure 26. An image showing the user right-clicking on CMD with their mouse and circling the option “Run as administrator.” (Image By: Steven Grevera* 

4: You will be greeted with a black box that should say the following: “C:/Windows/system32”. (This may also say System 64 if you are using a 64-bit version of Windows 10.)

5: Copy this command into the line: “bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy.” Type enter.

*Figure 27. An image inputting the "bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy" command into the "CMD" program. Image By: Steven Grevera* 

6: The following picture should be displayed. You have successfully enabled Safe Mode’s button press command. If this fails, ensure that you ran the program as outlined in #2 and #3.

*Figure 28. An image showing what happens after the command is input successfully. Image By: Steven Grevera* 

## Step 2: Boot Up

First, begin by turning on your computer. As this process begins, press the F8 key repeatedly to access the following screen.

Select the version of Safe Mode that suits your needs in the moment and the system will restart once again. You have successfully booted into Safe Mode. If the menu below does not pop up and instead it boots up normally, the button was likely not clicked fast enough.
