# Introduction

Shadow Corridor 2 is a maze-style horror game in which you are given a set predetermined theme, which is your “level,” or rather, “corridor,” in this sense. Each “corridor” is procedurally generated upon level selection based on a seed, which will ensure that each and every experience you have is unique. The layout learned from one session will not be the same layout for the next, even if they are the same corridor and vice versa.

*Figure 2: Image of a corridor generating in game. Image by: Steven Grevera.* 

Amo No Yohira is the spiritual land in which you find yourself, a world of the dead and a world of corrupted infesting water. Beware the water while your journey takes place here, lest you come to regret it.

*Figure 3: Image of the name of the realm the player is in. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

Your purpose in each corridor is to find an item known as Magatama, which are green jade-like objects that serve as “keys” to escape the maze. Your difficulty will determine how many you need to escape, scaling from 3-5. Upon obtaining the required Magatamas, you can then escape the level by finding the generated exit, which is never in the same place. Using a type of guide doll or a compass to help you find this exit as well. Keeping track of your progress through the use of glowing stones and your own mental notes as you progress through the maze.

Shadow Corridor 2 has a large fanbase primarily situated in Japan, yet many English players have also begun to play and enjoy the game. However, when looking up information about the game online, most of that information is in Japanese or translated very poorly into English. This guide aims to solve that issue by firmly establishing that information in proper English words and instructions. 

The purpose of this guide is to provide a clear and concise means and method to playing the game Shadow Corridor 2. While the game is English dubbed and even translated fairly well in the game itself, many aspects of the game reveal themselves to you over a long period of time. By reading ahead in this guide, you can save a run of a level and ultimately end up saving hours of work.

# Main Menu: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f7872a5-cae0-46d1-9a19-d82d603b67d0)
*Figure 5: Image of the main menu from the game. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

When you boot up the game software, these four options will present themselves to you accordingly. Hitting quit game will close the game software and take you out of everything.


 
# Start A New Game 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a22d0ba1-1bab-4e83-92f6-53f9c56aa102)
*Figure 6: Image showing the player's option when hitting start a new game with their save slots. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

Selecting Start A New Game will allow you to pick a save slot to use out of your three options, or it will wipe out an existing file if you desire to do so.  

## Continue

Selecting this option will allow you to continue from your saved file slot of your choice. 
 
# Game Options 

## Keyboard and Mouse or Controller Support

If you are using the Steam Version of Shadow Corridor 2, you have the option of using a Keyboard and Mouse and binding all your keys to your keyboard or using a Steam-supported controller type of your choice, such as the Duel Shock 4 controllers or an Xbox One style controller. This will be automatically detected upon your launching of the game. 

If you are using Nintendo Switch, you will use the Switch-based controllers or console buttons provided to you as your only option at this time. 



 
## Game Settings
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb84465-00b3-403f-8569-2a3992bc3e35)
*Figure 7: Image showing the options the player has in "Game Settings". Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

A series of options will be present in this tab, and each will have a different effect on your experience with the game. 

Language: Sets the language of the text from its choice selection. All dubbing is done exclusively in Japanese. 

Display Timer: When you are on a level, this option being enabled will allow you to see your time always displayed while playing in the mission itself. 

Item Inventory Display Time: The total number (in seconds) that the inventory will be displayed when expanded before it automatically closes itself. 

Display Item Info: This option will display item info when you highlight an item, such as the firecrackers, for example, to provide a tooltip that will provide a general idea of what the item in question does. Toggling it off or on based on your preference.

Look When Using Compass: As you traverse your generated corridor, you may run across an item called a compass. Read more on that here. If this option is disabled, then you cannot move and look at the compass at the same time. Having this enabled allows you to do so. This is for people who may find this as a distraction. 

Return To Base Immediately After Results: If this option is set to on, then upon completing a level, you will be sent back to the “hub” of the game. See more on this here. 

Vision Shake From Walking: This option will determine if your vision shakes from walking or not. For immersive experiences, this should be turned on. For those with motion sickness or who dislike this visual effect, keeping it off will ensure this does not occur. 

Controller Vibration: If your controller is in use, having this option set to on will result in certain in-game events causing your controller to shake, such as when an Apparition (the enemy monsters in the game-) approaches you. See more on monsters here.  

The Shaking of The Flashlight: With this option set to true, when you use your flashlight item, it will shake as you run as opposed to staying sturdy to light up areas. This option will provide a more immersive experience for those who want “realism” in their experiences. 

Whispers of The Remains: When collecting “souls” (more on this later), you will hear an audio sound effect when picking them off of skeleton bodies. Having this option off will display this effect for those who want to focus more on the sound of possible Apparitions instead.

 
## Control Settings
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4166a22c-6a99-42b6-b3d9-169b0cb78618)
*Figure 8: Image showing the options the player has in "Control Settings". Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

A series of options will be present in this tab, and each will have different effects on how your controller/mouse/keyboard operates and feels. 

Look Sensitivity Mouse: This option is exclusive to keyboard and mouse users; it determines the sensitivity when looking around from your first-person perspective with the mouse.

Look Sensitivity Controller: This option is exclusive to Controller Users; it determines the sensitivity when looking around from your first-person perspective with a controller.

Invert Horizontal Look Axis: Having this option on will reverse your movements of right and right with your desired control type. So, the left will go right, the right will go left, and vice versa. 

Invert Vertical Look Axis: Having this option on will reverse your movements of up and down looking with your desired control type. So up will go down and down will go up and vice versa. 

Crouch Control Type: Your options, being “Trigger” or “Hold,” will determine if you want to hold down your crouch key or simply press the button to toggle between crouching or standing. 

Spring (Sprint) Ground Type: This is currently a misspelled option, which is meant to say (Sprint) Ground Type. Your options being, “Trigger” or “Hold,” will determine if you want to hold down your sprint key or simply press the button to toggle between sprinting and walking.

Aim Assist Shooting: Currently, it will lock certain items that require pointing at apparitions just by aiming them down, such as the revolver pistol item.   

Aim Assist Interaction: This option will lock your interaction within a certain radius with doors or trigger fires from the revolver pistol. 


 
## Control Assignments 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db4234cb-4894-48fa-8f48-f19e67f331b9)
*Figure 9: Image showing the options the player has in "Control Assignments." Part 1 Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4370103-a7c8-4313-a4a4-48bd2bfe0502)
*Figure 10: Image showing the options the player has in "Control Assignments." Part 2 Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 
In this section, for keyboard and mouse, there will be a series of keybindings or mouse interactions that will activate the given action in the scenarios they list. The top is Mouse and Keyboard Settings and below is Gamepad Settings, which shows you what buttons are on your controller or gamepad and what they do.

 

## Graphics Settings 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1e4e1fc-9bf2-4d0a-b8d0-b9347d1f7b37)
*Figure 11: Image showing the options the player has in "Graphics Settings." Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

This tab is all about graphical settings for the game itself and will do various graphical things for the game itself. Options here will mostly affect your visuals in the game and be affected by your graphics card in your PC or system device. 

Brightness: Determines how bright the actual in-game world will be. 5 is the lowest setting and 20 is the highest. 

Window Mode: Determines how the game will be played, allowing you to window, window a simulated fullscreen mode, or to run the game in fullscreen mode. Windowed modes may take away from immersion but allow for easy tabbing in and out of the game. 

Resolution: Determines your screen resolution for the program itself. 

Indirect Lightning Quality: Determines lightning that is further away or possibly through reflective surfaces. Setting this to 0 will increase performance but lower graphical fidelity. 

Reflection Quality: Determines the quality and fidelity of real reflective surfaces such as mirrors and glass, as well as even water surfaces in the game. Lowering the option will increase performance.   

Level of Shadow Depiction: Determines the detail and graphical fidelity of shadows in the game cast about by objects and apparitions. Lowering the option will increase performance.  

Bloom: Bloom is a means to simulate light artifacting through a camera lens as opposed, more specifically, to what a human themselves might see. 

Motion Blur: Determines if motion blur will be used with movement in the game. Those looking for a more immersive experience can keep this on and those who wish to avoid any possible motion sickness issues can turn this off. 

Fish Eye Lens: A fish eyes lens effect is a panoramic type of view and can essentially transcend standard monitor images. Having this option on will only show an effect if a panoramic supporting device is used. 

FPS Cap: Setting an option value here will limit the FPS of the game to a certain value. Setting it to off will allow it to run without a cap. Setting FPS caps can improve performance if performance issues arise. Or if a preferred FPS is desired to be experienced without any deviations.

 
## Sound Settings

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261ae3d9-fe4d-4fe6-8a8d-9c6c3e28836d)
*Figure 12: Image showing the options the player has in "Sound Settings". Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

In this tab, you will find various audio levels for different sets of sounds and the levels at which they will be heard.

Master Volume: Determines the level of all sounds overall. 

BGM: The music volume for the main menu or cinematics. 

Corridor BGM: Determines music specifically when in Corridors (this includes Hub Sections). 

Sound Effects: This determines the volume of all sounds made by items, apparitions and miscellaneous sounds that may occur. 

Voice: Determines the voice for certain speaking apparitions but is mostly used as dialogue for cinematics or interactions with characters.

Footsteps: Determines the sound of your footsteps in the game if you wish to hear them. 

Environmental Sounds: This value determines the atmospheric sounds that can exist in corridors, such as water-style effects at levels that exist within them. 
 
# General Game Mechanics
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20c50b62-9a3b-43ba-88d0-417534ce5877)

*Figure 13: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory that is open and expanded. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

In order to survive traversing the corridors of this game, you must manage a series of survival mechanisms built into the game in order to succeed. These all must be managed successfully, or you could end up with a game over. This results in you having to generate a new level of the corridor and rediscover a brand-new layout from scratch.

 
## Lives (Candle’s Lit)
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f925d099-eea9-44b9-b8dd-39bbc10cf2ce)
*Figure 14: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded, with the lives indicator circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Once you find yourself at the level of a corridor, the candles will appear in the circled location of your screen at the top left. These candles indicate your lives. When you run out, you will obtain a “Game Over” and be given the option to “retry,” which will allow you to generate a brand new level of that corridor, or “Return to Base,” which will take you back to your Hub.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16676541-19bd-4633-bde9-bcca32e71acf)
*Figure 15: Image showing a "Game Over" in a corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

With a series of two items that can be found while exploring the corridors, you may find an extra life. Restoring one of your extinguished candles. 

**Note: You need all your candles to survive. Losing your third and final candle is a Game Over. You have three lives total and 0 in this context is counted as “Dead”.**

 
  



## Health
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f64a2dde-2dcb-4e68-9343-ff6c83994a01)
*Figure 16: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and the health bar indicator circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Next to the candles on the right side is a bar with a value of 100/100. The number on the left is your current health and the number on the right side is your maximum total health you can have. If your health on the left side reaches “0”, you will lose a candle and if you run out of candles, you will obtain a “Game Over” as a failure condition.

Several items can restore health as well as certain [Karuta](#anchor5)  and even [Coffee Effects](#anchor6) to try and keep you alive. You can even increase your maximum health by finding a special well/pool room found in your journeys, increasing your max health to 130 at the cost of 1000 souls. [Click here for more information on that special room.](#anchor7)


## Stamina
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f022da8-1d9e-4e15-aa0a-38405e47f9aa)
*Figure 17: Image showing the in game UI and stamina circle indicator circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

Stamina is used to sprint in the game and allows for running if being chased or just traversing things faster. Stamina can be increased in its regeneration rate but never in its maximum amount. Using coffee, karuta and some passive items.  

## Magatama Total
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ae82b6-d914-4b88-bbd1-d8c3b8bb2413)
*Figure 18: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and Magatama count indicator circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

To the right of your candles and right below your health bar is the total amount of Magatama you have in your current level session. As you pick one up, you will obtain a green glowing orb in the orbs listed in that section. If you play at higher levels, this count of three can be raised to five. You must have all orbs glowing green in order to properly use the level exit.

## Souls: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4932c701-5a63-4331-9685-c082b086984f)
*Figure 24: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and the Souls Counter circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Souls are the currency of the corridors. You can use souls for various things, such as karuta effects such as the map which will drain them constantly. Items from [The Butterfly Shop](#anchor8) and [other helpful corridor rooms](#anchor9) and for things such as the [Butterfly Lantern Light Source](#anchor10)

Souls are obtained through checking resource gathering spots, which are specific and designated in design based on the corridor typing. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ce8a616-36e8-4f1d-85c9-85e7c2fff465)
*Figure 25: Image showing a Soul Farming Spot (Resource Gathering Spot). Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Or by finding skeletons in hallways or rooms, which can appear within any corridor.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b76537-98a0-468b-b04d-40aa4e9a34bf)
*Figure 26: Image showing a corpse which you can get souls from and cleanse corruption. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Interacting with either of these objects will net the player a number of souls. The number obtained for the player can be upgraded with certain karuta for those who want to play with heavy souls earning potential build.

## Items
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf0449f0-db63-4215-9b17-fe97985e1659)
*Figure 27: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and the inventory slots circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Items are placed within the circled section, and this section will display your maximum inventory size. By pressing your designated inventory button, you can open this menu to look as the image above does, though yours might appear smaller in slots. That is due to the fact that in the image above, a karuta is being used, which increases the total number of inventory slots you have for unique items. 

Items have a set number that can be picked up. For example, glowing stones cap under normal circumstances at 20 stones. You can not duplicate an item beyond that cap into a second slot. Each slot is for unique items only. However, with a karuta, you can increase the cap of the held number of the item in question by a set amount that is varied by that item type.

For more information on all items in Shadow Corridor 2, [click here](#anchor11)


## Passive Items
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c10183f-e9c4-4061-b969-705508d9b1a2)
*Figure 28: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and the passive inventory slot circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Passive items are held items that you hold on your left side of your inventory that have various effects. Such as Insect Repellent, which makes it so insect-based Pests cannot deal damage to the player or will even be alerted to their presence.

Passive items are used up without a button needing to be pressed, which will be indicated by a Grey Bar outlining the passive items uses. Some items will activate a single time, such as the charm item shown above, when the player is grabbed, teleporting them away. 

With the right karuta, a player may hold up to 2 passive items at any given time. Allowing for more effects to be active at once. 

For more information about the existing passive items in Shadow Corridor 2, see the [following section](#anchor12)



## Light Source Items
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe28a4e6-b23b-448b-9912-6407fee34bfe)
*Figure 29: Image showing the in-game UI along with the inventory open and expanded and the Light Source inventory slots circled in red. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Light Source items are various items that provide light source in an area but may also have other effects. In Shadow Corridor 2, you always start with an infinite basic light source in the “Lighter,” which is obtained at the start of the game and exists no matter what. It cannot be replaced.

*Figure 30: Image showing how a Flashlight's light looks in darkness. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

When a light source is on, not only will a room get brighter, it may have an effect. You can see this item is “on” based on the small sun icon beneath the light source item itself. Some light sources are stronger than others in terms of “brightness”; for example, the flashlight is stronger in directed light than the lighter. However, more light makes it easier for apparitions to find the player, and it is one of the easiest ways to get spotted. 

For more specifics on Light Source items, [see here]#anchor10).

## Corruption 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a29ffb7a-622d-407b-bf01-7a0b09104d41)
*Figure 32: Image showing where the "corruption" bar will be located and how it fills up should you be afflicted with it. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Corruption builds up with exposure to water in Shadow Corridor 2, as The Shadow Corridors are part of a larger realm of the dead. Water applies to things such as “Swamps,” which can spawn randomly in the world or as specific parts of specific corridor types. Another type of “water” that can fill this gauge is “rain.” This rain will build up corruption. 

On deluge difficulty, this water will bombard you and become even more deadly in all of it’s forms as well. 

If corruption reaches its maximum possible allocation, it will cause an instant life to be lost, or if it’s your last life, a game over. 

Using certain karuta can allow for corruption to be negated through the use of passive items that can be obtained at the start of your level’s session, or certain coffee effects can also be utilized to lower the rate at which corruption builds.  

On most difficulties other than deluge, the best way to get rid of corruption entirely is to walk over to a skeleton’s remains. Flowers growing out of it will drain your corruption bar until it is entirely free. Making skeletons good to seek out in corridors with heavy amounts of swamp and rain.


 
## Insanity 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/393cc28b-9a7c-4ee1-a920-b4b6c31c10d7)
*Figure 33: Image showing where the "insanity" bar will be located and how it fills up should you be afflicted with it. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Insanity is a yellow bar that will fill up far rarer than corruption. It is caused by being in proximity to certain apparitions or environmental factors that can be triggered in the corridors. 

When insanity is built up to the max, you will be stunned in place and let out a loud scream. Alerting apparitions to your location or if you were in a chase, causing you usually to get caught if you don’t break out of it fast enough. By clicking on the indicated button fast, you can break the stun faster. You will also take health damage while in this state.

 
## Hiding Places
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c1dc97-f9ea-49de-9453-3a3fb7f9e076)
*Figure 34: Image showing the inside of a hiding place from "Underworld Academy." Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Throughout the corridors, you will find places that you can hide in if an Apparition is on your tail or nearby. These places of protection must be found in order to avoid being discovered and if you have your light source on without the right karuta on, you can still be discovered. So it’s best to keep that off. All corridors have different types of hiding places that can range from closets to tiny baskets, depending on the corridor in which you find yourself exploring.

*Figure 37: Image showing The Barkeep when you first enter the game. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


After getting through the game's intro, you will arrive at the hub. In the hub, there will be several options that will assist you in your corridor explorations.

## Hub Music Control

By interacting with this device while in the hub, you can cycle through a series of soundtracks in the game itself. Pick your favorite one! Feel free to change it at any time by coming to this location.

# Karuta Cards
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48f05b1e-724c-4f30-a0f8-09be400f5302)
*Figure 39: Image showing a Karuta Card's artwork known as Doll Calling from in-game. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Karuta Cards are benefits that you bring into your corridor explorations that all have different benefits and effects. One such example is above. Gamers with experience with other games might call these “Perks.” 

Karuta are one of Shadow Corridor 2’s most powerful benefits, as they can completely change your experience while exploring corridors; as their effects can be extremely powerful and dynamically change aspects of the game in some way. They can vary from things like using a special map that can help you navigate to simple but powerful buffs like stat resistances to certain negative traits you can run into while exploring, such as Corruption.

*Figure 40: Image showing a Karuta Card's loadout and changing screen. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Karuta are limited to five total by the end game of Shadow Corridor 2, with an extra slot possible if found in a level itself for a price. 

To select your Karuta loadout at The Hub, come to the location listed below and interact with the table.

## Sealed Karuta Cards

Corrupted  Human’s or Impure look like the above and if they grab you, they will hold onto you for a bit and they will then seal a karuta card at random. Some karuta can protect this sealing effect from occurring but so too can [certain coffee effects](anchor6). **Note as well that while grabbed, you can still be harmed by hostile apparitions. You will also take health damage from the grab itself.**

*Figure 44: Image showing a Corrupted Human Pest grabbing the player with the clairvoyance item on. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The only way to unseal karuta is to spend 1000 souls at the butterfly shop, which is randomly located in each corridor. Spending 1000 souls will unseal all karuta at once for the exact same price, meaning that in some situations, it might be better to wait for more to be sealed before spending your souls while out exploring. 
 


## Bonus Karuta Slot
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9239ad18-8c36-4472-800c-c4b4039445f4)
*Figure 45: Image showing a bonus Karuta Table Room found while in a corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

While exploring in Corridors, you may find a Karuta card table. By spending 1500 at these randomly generated locations, you will unlock an additional Karuta slot for the rest of that corridor's exploration and it will be lost on its completion or a game over while exploring. 

The bonus karuta card gained is completely up to you to choose from and will bring up your menu of existing cards accordingly. While looking through your cards, the game is paused and so is the corridor timer. So take as long as you need!

## Buying More Karuta

*Figure 48: Image showing The Barkeep with the option to buy more Karuta Cards. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*




Karuta are bought with Magatama, which you obtain 1 of per your explorations outside of the hub in corridors itself. You do not have to complete exploration in full of a corridor or even finish a session to obtain this currency to spend. The moment you pick one up in a corridor, it is added to your inventory.

To buy Karuta, talk to the barkeep and select the “Buy Karuta” option. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56443f93-995f-46b1-a02e-91b09a9d224d)
*Figure 49: Image showing what happens when you select to buy more Karuta Cards. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 


Five total options will be displayed at a single time and to refresh your options, you must spend a Magatama. When a Karuta card is bought, a new one is not added. 

Any time the game is loaded, or a corridor exploration ends and you load back into the hub world, your options offered will refresh free of charge.

# Coffee

*Figure 51: Image showing the main character drinking her coffee. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

 

Coffee provides smaller but helpful benefits to the player at a selection of 1 of each. Unlocking other coffee requires Coffee Bean Bags, which can be found while exploring corridors.

*Figure 52: Image showing a Coffee Bean collectible item bag out in a corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Collecting a coffee bean bag while exploring corridors, regardless of whether you complete it to its exit or get a “game over,” keeps the bean forever in your total collected amount. Each corridor can only have a set amount collected within its maximum before it no longer counts toward your grand total. This amount can be seen on the corridor-level selection screen.

To access the coffee menu, select the clipboard menu on the table from Figure 50 and you will be greeted to a selection of options listed below in Figure 54.

*Figure 54: Image showing the coffee menu options. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

Selecting an option will cause your character to drink some coffee as an animation and give you the coffee benefit that you selected. **Please note that using a coffee item despite its numerical “cost” does not actually use any beans and is more of an unlock requirement, not a “cost.”**


 
 

## All Coffee’s and Their Effects

| Coffee Name | Coffee Bean Unlock Amount | 		Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Week Coffee | 	Basic Unlock | 	The amount of souls acquired increases slightly. (The increase is about 10%) | 
| Cafe au Lait | 	10 Coffee Beans | 	The effect on the Apparitions hearing and vision is slightly reduced. (The heartbeat and blinking sound while running are not noticeable even if you switch to walking.) | 
| Espresso | 	20 Coffee Beans | 	Slightly increases stamina recovery speed. (Stamina recovery speed increases by 1.25% per second) | 
| Cafe latte | 	30 Coffee Beans | 	Always recovers a small amount of stamina. (Recovers 1 every 18 seconds) | 
| Dutch Coffee | 	40 Coffee Beans | 	Slightly increases resistance to corruption. (The rate at which corruption accumulates is reduced by approximately 12.5%) | 
| Affogato | 	50 Coffee Beans | 	Slightly increases resistance to insanity. (Time until screaming increased from 30 seconds to about 37 seconds) | 
| Cafe Macchiato | 	60 Coffee Beans | 	The durability and souls consumed by items is slightly reduced. (Maps of Underworlds are not affected) | 
| Shekarat | 	70 Coffee Beans | 	Slightly decreases the chance of the karuta being sealed. | 
| Cappuccino | 	80 Coffee Beans | 	Slightly increases item appearance rate. | 
| Turkish Coffee | 	90 Coffee Beans | 	When you obtain a magatama, there is a small chance that the a light of life (life point) will be lit (you gain a new life point). | 
| Dandyism Blend | 	100 Coffee Beans | Slightly increases the chances of Bearded Dandy activating and of positive effects occurring from it’s use. |

To select a corridor to play through, open a door toward the back of the bar on your right and then walk up to a well with the stone carving of a snail’s face and eyes. 

Look into the water section of this well and hit the interact button to access the list of corridors from which to choose from. 

The moment your corridor is generated and loaded and you confirm you are ready with the destinated key, you will enter the corridor’s spawn point, which is usually fixed in its typing. Its location within the larger level of the corridor, however, is not fixed and could be near the exit or far. A timer has also begun, which keeps track of the time you spend on the level. 

To complete a corridor level, you must successfully collect three or five Magatama, depending on your difficulty choice. Then, you must find the exit of the level to successfully complete the corridor. 

If you fail to exit the level and run out of lives, all of your progress in that generated level of the corridor will be lost and you will be returned to the hub, or you may retry. Depending on which you may rather do. 


## Corridors

Select one of the levels on this screen to be taken to the corridor in which you wish to play a level. 

Each map has a gimmick that will trigger depending on the situation. For Beginner and Intermediate, for example, it will occur on the 3rd Magamata obtained, the for intermediate, it will occur on the 5th as well. On advanced, however, it will occur with every Magamata picked up except for Sea of Reminiscence, which will only have the gimmick occur on the 3rd and 5th pick ups. 

When exploring, you might find areas rarely that have rain coming through the ceiling. The amount of these that can spawn increases based on the difficulty you choose to play the corridor on. 

Below are a series of options and what is unique to each of them.

### Underworld Academy
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5551254-b227-4e7a-9b6c-f13a027a05f5)

The Underworld Academy is the first Corridor you will explore when you start and play the game’s story mode. To obtain souls, you will search single school dressers that contain souls within. To turn on the lights, you will turn on the classroom-style lights that are above your head everywhere you go.

*Figure 59: Image showing a dark hallway in the academy. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The gimmick of this map involves a school bell loudly ringing any time the gimmick is triggered, which will slowly build up your insanity in a large radius and attract Apparitions to you as a result if you do not clear the area or find a place to hide out. Eventually, the bell will stop ringing, so be sure you're ready to escape to safety before picking up the Magatama.

### Corridor of Endless Rain
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201376d7-9221-4a4b-b28d-b312f051457b)
*Figure 65: Image showing the starting room in the Corridor of Endless Rain. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Corridor of Endless Rain is within a house or inn of some kind that seems to stretch on endlessly. Certain large opening sections covered with doors, will reveal openings to the outside world, yet constantly pour endless rains on that outside. This causes issues for the player in terms of corruption buildup.

*Figure 69: Image showing rain on the outside of the Corridor of Endless Rain #2. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*



The light source of the map are tiny square lamps that are set up across the level and the farming objects are large vases on the ground that, when interacted with, will emit a green light to acquire souls.

*Figure 71: Image showing the soul-farming object in the Corridor of Endless Rain. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The corridor's gimmick can be devastating if you aren’t yet used to dealing with the corruption status buildup, which, when activated by obtaining the right amount of Magatama, will cause the rain to drip through the ceiling and onto the player. This causes an endless buildup of corruption unless skeletons or other means are found. The range is not infinite but it is large. On advanced and beyond, in practice, this means the entire corridor will eventually end up with rain dripping from the ceiling and leaving very few areas to be safe.

### Hydrangea Street
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57e3f38-5575-497f-a22c-c8dd33245299)
*Figure 73: Image showing rain pouring down in an open section on Hydrangea Street. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

A large open street that endlessly stretches amidst a mix of a town and alleyways. The area is very dark and occurs at night, with many locations having rain dripping down. The only escape is entering the limited building entrances scattered throughout the level.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f512808d-1d01-4e53-9f05-08958d6e6daa)
*Figure 74: Image showing two alleys in Hydrangea Street. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Due to the building entrances being limited, items can be scarce on this level, and it is advised to bring key ones in ahead of time to make the best use of your situation while exploring levels of this corridor. 

Unlike most other corridors, there are two key gimmicks of this map. The first occurs every two minutes, in which an alarm will sound and Corrupted Humans will spawn all over and slowly seek you out. The time it takes for these lanterns to glow and trigger the spawns occurs based on your difficulty as such: 

- Beginner: about 10 minutes,
- Intermediate - 4.5 to 6.5 minutes
- Advanced or Deluge - 3 to 5 minutes

In addition to the set times above, the gimmick will also occur on the final magatama pick up on intermediate and beyond but from that moment on, the lamps will never turn off, meaning the large spawn of Corrupted Humans will never disappear without your direct intervention through the use of [Firecrackers or The Revolver Pistol Item](#anchor11).

*Figure 76: Image showing the lanterns not lit up in Hydrangea Street. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
 
The second gimmick is that ice popsicle trucks will be around the map and finding one will reward the player with three ice popsicle items, which they can use to increase health and stamina upon consumption. Just be careful not to use three in a row unless you want the medal, as you’ll take a temporary stun from “brain freeze”.

The Light Source of the map are large street lamps which interacting with at the points with the red hand prints, will turn on. Inside, are the electrical lamps that were also seen in Underworld Academy.

The “farming soul object” of this level is a cabinet that, when interacted with, will display a green fire effect and give souls to the player.

### Mausoleum 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29172cd0-f907-4ab7-937c-f27acb98facf)
*Figure 82: Image showing the starting room of The Mausoleum Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

This enclosed cave-like location houses many spirits of the dead and will set even the hardest of people on edge.

*Figure 84: Image showing how underground it looks in The Mausoleum Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 

 
The corridor has three gimmicks this time. On this corridor, if at any point you turn off your light source, the spirits of the damned will begin to clutter your screen and terrorize your senses of hearing and sight. This will slowly build up your insanity, making hiding from Apparitions hard without finding hiding places to remain hidden. If you find a hiding spot, you can turn your light off. A strong counter to this gimmick is the Butterfly Lantern, as Apparitions cannot see this light but it will nonetheless scare away the spirits of the corridor.

*Figure 85: Image showing how the first map gimmick appears on the screen when the light is off in The Mausoleum Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 
The second gimmick occurs at the standard rate of obtaining Magamata and, depending on your difficulty level. This gimmick is that when you pick up a Magamata, a woman’s head will spawn and shriek at you, causing a massive build-up of insanity at a fast rate, as well as making noise for Apparitions to hear if any are nearby. Making it critical to factor all this in before picking one up.

*Figure 86: Image showing how a woman's face and lower body appear to scream in The Mausoleum Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 
The final gimmick will appear like a generation bug in appearance: a sudden endless void drops at random points of the map, and if you fall down these, it is an instant death, resulting in a life lost or a game over if you are out of lives. 

The Light Source item of this corridor is that of the small lanterns that are hanging from the ceilings. The soul-farming object is a continuation of the vase item from Corridor of Endless Rain.

### Shrine
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7308654a-5bfd-4c2b-89eb-9b18186afaa9)
*Figure 89: Image showing the entrance with guards guarding The Shrine. Lit up by a Butterfly Lantern's Light. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

For those who thought the Mausoleum was disturbing, The Shrine takes things to the next level. The level always starts outside of the shrine, which you must open using a lever outside to open it up. Greeting you to the dolls at the front entrance.

*Figure 92: Image showing a connection point within The Shrine. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
 
 
Throughout the map, are mechanical dolls that appear stationary. However, if you see one that has its lights flashing, do not enter its light, or else you will trigger an alarm and the Mechanical Doll will then become an Apparition that will chase you. Other than the Shion, it is one of the fastest entities in the game and the hardest to escape. However, they operate entirely on visuals alone, meaning you can be about as loud as you want. However, they are still affected by firecracker karuta, which scares them away.

*Figure 93: Image showing a Mechanical Doll's yellow glowing eyes waiting for someone to enter it's sight within The Shrine. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 
 
The light source object of the map are small candles waiting for you to light and the soul farming object is a barrel that, when interacted with, will show a small green fire light, which grants souls. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b26ba4d-1790-4565-96e7-b86110ed6b4e)

*Figure 95: Image showing the soul-farming object within The Shrine. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Gimmick of this map is that depending on your difficulty when you obtain a certain amount of Magatama, you will hear loud activating and rolling sounds throughout the shrine. This will not affect the entire shrine but it will affect a large area around where the gimmick was triggered, causing all the mechanical dolls in a large radius to activate and begin to patrol the level as a hostile Apparition that isn’t detectable by heartbeat warnings, only the rolling/grating sound it makes as it travels along. 

On Advanced and Deluge, this level becomes extremely hard as Dolls will be activated in a large amount with every single Magatama picked up. It is best to go into this level with a load-out focused on stunning and scaring away Apparitions, as avoiding them all by means of stealth is nearly impossible and extremely time-consuming.

### Missing Windhole

*Figure 97: Image showing the large gate entrance to The Missing Windhole Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Missing Windhole corridor is unique as it is entirely a boss corridor. Your sole objective in this corridor is to defeat the pursuing boss Apparition by draining its health bar using barrels scattered across the level, which is not procedurally generated and is, in fact, predetermined to be exactly the same, in fact, even ending at some point if the encounter drags on for too long and you don’t die a single time. Requiring you to use a mirror to return to the start.

*Figure 99: Image showing a pulley lever that must be used to open the gate while being pursued by the boss in The Missing Windhole Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 
 
The corridor continues until the boss is defeated, in which you are then treated to a triggered cutscene, which allows you to exit the corridor. The corridor is not majorly generated but is to an extent, providing a large amount of fixed aspects but with some variance per playthrough of a variety of room types you can and will encounter.

#### Deluge Eyes Only:

*Figure 112: Image showing the bosses return exclusively in The Missing Windhole Corridor on deluge Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

On deluge, the boss returns after being defeated in a new form and must be defeated yet again for a “Phase 2”. This consists of everything being the same as “Phase 1”, only now you're on a more crunched timer due to the corruption buildup constantly draining your health. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5935090d-36a3-4f6e-81bf-47febd895b6a)
*Figure 113: Image showing how dark it can get in The Missing Windhole Corridor on deluge Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
 
Your field of view will be obscured by corrupting mist making it not only hard to see where your going but put you on a bit of a time limit based on your health of corruption meter. Your only hope of maintaining more time is running to the skeletons to purge your corruption but since it’s deluge, the corruption will take a tad longer to clear and be more deadly. Truly putting you on a timer. As even if you clear it, it will begin again. It is recommended to bring a Purifying Hydrangea karuta in order to deal with the corrupting mist for the 2nd phase. 

Once the boss is defeated, they will drop an object for you to pick up on this level and you will then simply exit the corridor.

### Glass Building

*Figure 115: Image showing the starting room on the Glass Building Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The light source of this level are Japanese Lamps, which hang on the ceiling and are extremely fancy and also some on the ground like from Corridor of Endless Rain. The means to obtain souls is through a music box usually situated on top of dressers.

The Gimmick of the map is that upon obtaining the required number of Magatama, dependent on your difficulty level, red crystals will shoot out all around where you took the Magatama from and spread out in a wide radius. Walking normally or running on them will cause 1 point of damage for each step and give the impression and sound of walking on glass. However, to avoid taking damage, you can crouch walk carefully, which can take up a large amount of time, or with the Feather of Darkness Passive Item or Karuta card.

### Sea of Trees Complex
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf38f273-7add-45db-97b2-790a0d4d4934)
*Figure 122: Image showing the spawn location in The Sea of Trees Complex. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Sea of Trees Complex is a mostly outdoor corridor with sections inside abandoned and dilapidated buildings, which are usually blocked off with pot traps that, upon touching, will explode with corruption smoke and damage the player.

*Figure 124: Image showing a large open section between a series of buildings in The Sea of Trees Complex. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 
 
The gimmick of the map is fairly simple but extremely hard to deal with in that with the corresponding Magatama obtained, the mushrooms all over the walls across the corridor will glow in a wide radius and emit particle spores. These spores will stop stamina regeneration entirely at the higher levels and decrease it at the lower levels. It will also make compasses spin unendingly and without any control. Making them useless. Dolls, however, will still function if the player buys them.

*Figure 125: Image showing the map gimmick of the walls starting to glow in the darkness part 1 in The Sea of Trees Complex. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

Any stamina regeneration passive item, coffee effect, or consumable item will bypass this inability to regenerate stamina. Making them mandatory items. Of course, be mindful that the stamina regen will be extremely slow if you only use one of the many options at your disposal. Meaning this level can drag on at higher difficulties.

As the level is largely outdoors, rain is all outside, causing large amounts of corruption building. Worse, large bodies of swamps separate sections of the corridor at some locations and pests are in large amounts and call this place home.

*Figure 128: Image of a swamp outside in The Sea of Trees Complex. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera* 

As much of the level is outdoors, item spawn rates are not common as they require desks, which also serve as the means of gathering souls, other than the usual skeletons that you should utilize heavily in this corridor. 

The light source of this map is a large mushroom-style lamp that starts turned off that you yourself must turn on. The Farming Soul Item is the Underworld Academy’s desk that returns for this level.

### Sea of Reminiscence

*Figure 130: Image of sprawling large, towering hands bound in chains in the dark ocean that is this Corridor. The Sea of Reminiscence. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Sea of Reminiscence is a stronghold of corruption; the entire level is underwater, and as a result, every second counts. The level is very reminiscent of the beginning of the story, the main character's apartment, yet it spirals and sprawls endlessly with no way down and hands reaching up for the sky in vain under the imposing darkness of this endless sea.

Dark tendrils are scattered throughout the map that have no effect on the player itself but will give you a freight for sure. The light source is a blue lamp that can be turned on. The farming items are mirrors that, when interacted with, will break and grant souls.

The gimmick of the corridor involves the spawning of a special Apparition, that entity being “The Trauma,” which is without a doubt the hardest Apparition in the game to deal with. It will announce itself loudly with a unique shrieking wail sound, yet it doesn’t matter as the panic will quickly set in as you realize you cannot hide from this Apparition. Wherever you go, however far you try and escape, it will know where you are and will pursue you with unlimited stamina, compared to your limited amounts. The only way to deal with the trauma is to stun it via the ‘26 Revolver Pistol or sacrifice a candle of life (life point) to cremate it, which will permanently remove it from the level for that single one.

It is highly advised not to trap a Trauma in a barrier, as doing so will result in it multiplying on Deluge difficulty and it’s best to get in the habit of not having to barrier it to deal with it now, as to not make the mistake later down the line.

## Difficulty

*Figure 144: Image of the different difficulty levels you can choose after you've selected a corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Shadow Corridor 2’s difficulty levels are fairly straightforward and pretty well kept to their names. However, much of what has changed isn’t clear until you play the game at higher levels, and by then, you may have forgotten how you started. If you are new to the Shadow Corridor franchise or maze-style games in general, you should certainly pick Beginner.
 
### Beginner 

- The easiest way to play the game. In total you must obtain three magatama . 
- Items spawn in great quantity. 

- The running speed of Apparitions is slower and the distance that they chase is much shorter then higher levels. 

- It takes a longer period of time for Apparitions to break down doors when in pursuit. 

- Apparitions detection of sound is very low

- Karuta being sealed is very low. 

- Levels are smaller in size that other levels

- The number of pests is very low. 

- There is less rain dripping ceiling locations.

- Corruption buildup is very slow. 

- Damage is halved. 

- At the start of the game, magatama rooms are not always locked and can be just open without the need of a key. 

- All Trap Room Magatama rooms are unlocked.

- Gimmick usually only occurs once in most maps. 
 
### Intermediate 

- A more average experience, preparing you for harder difficulties of the game. The number of magatama collected is set to 5, as opposed to 3. 

- There are still many items.

- The running speed of Apparitions is more accurate to their true speeds and you must shake them off more efficiently as a result. 

- The detection of which they can hear you is increased from beginner but still not too intense. About the range of your heartbeat and slightly beyond. If you can see flashing lights, they can hear you if you make loud sounds.

- You are more likely to have your karuta sealed if you’re grabbed by a Corrupted Human. 

- The map is larger. 

- There still remain a lower number of pests. 

- There is a slightly higher amount of rain dripping ceiling locations. 

- The corruption accumulation is higher and will become far more of a factor.

- Magatama Trap Rooms are now locked properly like other rooms, aside from in rarer instances toward the starting levels of the game.

- The stage gimmick can occur twice. After picking up your 3rd Magatama and your 5th and final. 

### Advanced

- Your built up skills at this point will be tested to your known limits in this difficulty. 

- There are far more Apparitions that can and will spawn. 

- Wandering Shion can patrol the hallways in rare circumstances. 

- Item counts are much smaller then previously. 

- The time if takes an Apparition to break down doors is decreased by a large amount. 

- The range in which an Apparition can hear you is greatly increased. 

- Corrupted Humans will almost always seal karuta if you are grabbed without any assistance.

- The map is even larger then previous difficulties, making for longer amounts of time exploring.

- There are a lot of pests now.

- There are many leaking ceiling locations throughout the corridors.

- The corruption builds up faster then Intermediate. 

- All Magatama Rooms are closed except the Mayubo room. However, after The Shrine level, these rooms also become locked as well. 

- The stage gimmick is activated each time you obtain a magatama, and the range of the stage gimmick increases slightly. 
 

### Deluge 

- The hardest difficulty in Shadow Corridor 2, this will break you and force you to escape your comfort zones. 

- Initially only one Candle Light (Life Point) is lit, however, if you find other candles throughout the corridor’s exploration, you can increase this up to a maximum of three.

- From the beginning, enemies that wouldn’t usually appear now will do so, such as more unique ones such as the Mizuchi Apparition

- There are many Apparitions in a large quantity. 

- There are a lot of pests.

- The number of leaking ceiling locations is extremely high. You will deal with corruption.

- When the soul is retrieved from the corpse, the four petals wither and the corpse is no longer able to purify corruption.

- Normal magatama is replaced with corrupted magatama that when picked up, will increase your buildup or start it. It will also continue to build up for 30 seconds after picking one up after the initial pick up.

- There is a 35% chance upon picking up a magatama that a karuta will also be sealed.

- If you are grabbed by a corrupted human, you are guaranteed to have a karuta sealed, no matter what resistances you have.

- Magatama rooms spawn in less frequency. 

- Trauma will appear after you collect 5 Magatama in each corridor. This will not double for Sea of Reminiscence however.

- The range of stage gimmicks is increased further slightly
 

## Light Markers
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4424af56-4490-4af2-b8fd-793ba5d2aec6)
*Figure 145: Image of an example of a light source in Shadow Corridor 2. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Across your designated corridor’s level, you might find various forms of interactable light sources. Turning these on will mark the area you explored and provide you with higher visibility in the area. However, what provides you with better visibility may also provide the apparitions with higher visibility as well depending on the corridor 2. So keep this in mind when deciding which lights to turn on.

## Trapdoors 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a748c8e3-c6ce-4b18-93ec-fca64d4b2758)
*Figure 146: Image of a trap door that hasn't been stepped on yet. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Trapdoors will spawn in the ground on rare occasions, leading to linked locations. If you walk over one twice, you will fall through. However, if you walk over it once while being pursued by an Apparition, the Apparition that walks over it will fall through the trapdoor, saving you from the chase. If you fall through yourself, you will be teleported to the corresponding location connected with the trapdoor around the corridor, which is randomly generated. However, an Apparition that falls through will simply despawn.

# Special Rooms

Across the levels you explore amongst the corridors, you will encounter special variances to the usual layouts. These special rooms have a purpose to them or will stand out with a purpose to you in some way. They generate randomly and some only appear in certain corridor types, for example, the swamp appearing more so in The Shrine then the first level. Though a variant of the swamp can appear as [The Swamp Trap](#anchor13) for the Magatama Room. 

 




## Extra Life (Candle) Rooms 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5025287-bf18-41bd-a384-09f786c455db)
*Figure 149: Image of the section where you would buy the candle for an extra life. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

These exist in two different parts, one of which contains a buyable candle for 1500 souls. (3000 in Marathon.) 

The second part is the actual shrine in which you place the candle. When placing the candle, you will obtain a new life if you have a candle extinguished.

*Figure 150: Image of where you would drop off the candle to obtain another Candle Light (Life Point). Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


 


## Doll Rooms
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8041a79-249f-4e49-b35d-2944a3b18c0b)
*Figure 151: Image of a Doll on a table in a dark room, waiting to be bought for 1500 souls. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

For the price of 1500 souls, you can buy this Doll, which will spawn on the ground nearby. The doll will then, upon being interacted with, wind up and will start to head in the direction of the level's exit. Serving as a guide to the exit for you. 

While you are within a certain range of the doll, due to the flower in which it is holding, you will be cleansed of all corruption buildup, allowing it to be used as a mobile safe hub from corruption all the way to the exit. 

For 800 souls instead, you can use one of your karuta card slots to spawn this same doll anywhere by inputting a button combination. This can also help with corruption if you are near full corruption build-up. You must select this card at the start of the game or as an extra slotted card if you can find the table.

## Extra Health Well Rooms
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0ecb10c-5456-46ae-a638-2f6625a038be)
*Figure 154: Image of a Well that you can spend 1000 souls in to obtain 30 extra health in a Corridor. With the clairvoyance item in use for the visual effect.  Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

For the price of 1000 souls, upon finding this well in a room, you can add 30 additional maximum health to your character for the duration of that level’s journey permanently. This effect persists even through death but does not persist beyond an exit/completion of a level or a “Game Over.”

*Figure 155: Image of the player's maximum health increased and restoring it to full after spending 1000 souls at the well in clairvoyance vision still. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 
 


## Swamps
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96682f1d-1be4-4a6d-98df-ccfa9afbe49f)
 *Figure 156: Image of a Swamp that has spawned in The Shrine in Butterfly Lantern Light. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
 
Swamps don’t spawn on every corridor unless it is at the higher difficulties for the “Swamp Trap” Magatama rooms. The swamps, when walked in, will slow down the player’s movement drastically and also build up corruption at a fast rate. Traversing these could be extremely dangerous as a result. 

Apparitions are not slowed by these, unlike the player, so if being chased by one, factor this into your decision-making when choosing to traverse one.

## The Butterfly Shop
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/913f42cd-3c67-4a6e-93e1-fece1c3c545b)
*Figure 158: Image of The Shopkeeper in a Corridor. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Butterfly Shop is owned by The Shopkeeper: Hotaruya and has two means to get to it, which are mirrors that are randomly generated throughout the level of the corridor that you’re within. 

A good way to indicate that you are approaching a mirror entrance to the shop is to hear the sound of a toy box’s music playing. This music indicates that you are approaching a mirror, whether behind a locked door or somewhere within the level.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd8ba2a-ae16-4b20-bc5f-ba1180b29905)
*Figure 159: Image of The Cleansing flowers and other nit knacks that exist on a table presented to the player by the shopkeeper. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Upon interacting with the mirror, the player can then teleport into a Butterfly Shop Hub, which consists of the mirror you used to reach its location and another to another location somewhere else in the level. If you look into the mirror before teleporting back from the shop, you can usually see the state it’s in. If you see flashing lights, this is a good indication that apparitions are nearby and you may want to consider waiting to teleport to that area.

*Figure 160: Image of a mirror that leads to the connecting points of The Butterfly Shop. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Shopkeeper sells items for souls that range from items, passives, a single buyable coffee bean bag for the collection or archives. The Shopkeeper’s stock of an item is not unlimited and in the case of the coffee bean and the archive collectible, these can only be bought once in your save file per corridor. Whereas other items refresh on returns to the corridor after you escape or obtain a “Game Over” and generate a new one.

*Figure 161: Image of the butterfly shop menu with its item names, how much you own and the price of items at the shop. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 

By spending a certain amount of souls, the shopkeeper will reward you with special karuta items over time, and these do not have to be spent all at once and serve as tracking across your saved file.

# Corridor Items
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34ccb8ab-d725-4f3d-a5cf-4fc7b5c02e27)
*Figure 163: Image of items that have spawned in a drawer in The Underworld Academy. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Corridor items are items that you pick up while exploring the level of a corridor. Certain karuta cards allow you to start with specific items to achieve purposes. Items can be used for a variety of purposes, such as restoring health and stamina, scaring away apparitions, pests or drawing their attention somewhere else. Some are used to mark areas of the map or light up the map as a light source. Meanwhile, others can be used to combat apparitions directly through the use of stunning or outright forced removal with the right item in hand. 

Items are collected by opening drawers scattered throughout the corridor levels in the form of desks and tables and they are always indoors on levels that have an outside and inside. 

The Compass item is a unique item that spawns at a very rare chance from drawers and, when found, will display the exit’s location, guiding the player to the means of escape.

When picking up items as well, there is a chance for you to be jumped by spiders as a “trap” that will do damage to you. This can also sometimes result in a karuta being sealed. The way to tell if it’s a trap or not is that the drawer should be slightly open but not all the way and it should seem to get “stuck.” This will tell you the drawer is a trap. You can open it again to take damage and there will usually be an item inside. Giving you a choice: Some of your health and a karuta sealing chance for an item, or ignore it.

## Specific Corridor Items

| Item Name | Use |
|---|---|
| Onigiri | Restores health and stamina. | 	
| Firecrackers  | Directs Apparitions to the sound of the firecracker and covers your own footsteps as you traverse the level. Can also be used to scare away “Pest” level foes. |

# Apparitions (Enemies)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a44ed994-d096-4678-abd4-6ca2a8ade344)
*Figure 167: Image of a Shion crying in the darkness. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Apparitions are wandering enemies that will usually proceed to extinguish a life should the player be caught by them, regardless of health value. All Apparitions behave differently and have unique characteristics. Some are even unique to specific corridors themselves or have specific difficulties in those corridors. 

To avoid an Apparition, players need to hide without any light sources in the corridor's safe hiding zone, which will change its appearance and type each corridor type. Some may be closets; some may be small baskets. If an Apparition finds you while you are hiding within a hiding spot due to unfortunate circumstances, you will lose a life regardless of health value. 

Apparitions spawn based on the location of the player as well as how fast they are moving through the corridor and the amount of noise they are making. Once an Apparition is spawned, usually near the player, they will track the player by those noises and lights that they are using. By using things like Butterfly Lanterns, they can appear mostly invisible to Apparitions, albeit unless they get close enough to the player. 

There are two key indicators to know that an apparition is nearby. One of the easiest to hear will be two distinct sounds. You will start to hear your own heartbeat, for starters. The second will proceed to be a unique sound to that entity itself. These sounds could be bells for the dancers or screams for the monsters. The other indicator is flickering light sources. If a light source is flickering, it means that you should find shelter. Not all entities use sound and your only means of knowing one is present is your heartbeat or the light sources flickering. 

When you are discovered, a red light will beam out of the Apparition and they will pursue you. Until that red light disappears, you are in “pursuit,” and if they catch you, it’s a life lost or a game over if it’s your last one. 

If you are being chased by an Apparition and you close a door behind yourself, depending on the Apparition in question, they will begin to bang on the door you closed on them as if it was locked. After a certain amount of hits, they will break through and continue to chase you. This allows you to use doors as a means to buy time should you be pursued.


 
## Apparition Types



### Teru teru bōzu (Screaming Dolls)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b94cf4a7-e06c-4c9e-bc40-160bc3d1d8a6)
*Figure 168: Image of a Teru teru bōzu Doll coming right for the player. Image Taken From: https://img.wiki3.jp/shadowcorridor2amanoyohira/teruteru.jpg*

Apparitions that are covered in branded white cloth covering their faces. Their lower body of “feet” are hands and can be identified from far distances due to their loud screaming and constantly shaking speed of their limbs. They cannot hear sounds due to how loud they are and so are not prone to sounds other than firecrackers. They also only ever look in front of themselves and will not look behind unless they turn their entire bodies around. 


 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d667a70-cdcf-4e0f-bba7-360130e45fa6)
*Figure 169: Image of a Teru teru bōzu running past a barriered door. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Teru teru bōzu can destroy doors extremely fast and, on the higher levels, destroy doors instantly. They will destroy doors even if they haven’t spotted you sometimes. This is not cause for panic if you are not being chased; simply duck into cover and wait for their business to conclude.  

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0c06fc-cd2e-40f6-9c6b-a51c2b3b71c5)
*Figure 170: Image of a Teru teru bōzu's outline as seen from the clairvoyance item. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

If being chased by a Teru teru bōzu, try to find a trap door fast as they are extremely fast and without items to stun them, you will be in great trouble without the ability to block them with doors. 

Outside of the game, Teru teru bōzu is a Japanese doll tradition involving the creation of a handmade doll, often made of paper or cloth, that is hung outside to bring sunny weather and ward off rain. As this game is about “rain” and “water” in relation to the spirit world and death, this is their take on that tradition.
 

### Whirlpool Dancer (Kagura suzu)
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7c3c40-9718-49b4-985e-9fc1ffba45de)
*Figure 171: Image of a Whirlpool Dancer passing by a door while doing his twirl dance. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d610e7a2-6fe1-4845-8e27-cc6282172632)
*Figure 172: Image of a Whirlpool Dancer staring at a player through a door. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Whirlpool Dancer will first be heard by their ringing bells, which are Kagura suzu, a traditional Shinto instrument that is meant to entertain the Gods and worn by forms of priest traditional uses. The Dancer is an old man in a mask in appearance. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f7ad804-2b9b-4ed6-9928-0513e2f1f51e)
*Figure 173: Image of a Whirlpool Dancer's outline as seen through clairvoyance. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 
The Whirlpool Dancer has a full 360 degree vision, is it is advised not to try and sneak up behind them and to stay calm, quiet and in the darkness. At the bare minimum, use light sources they cannot see for themselves, such as The Butterfly Lantern, to avoid detection. They can hear you and can even sometimes find you even if you are crouched, so it is best to hide to the best of your ability and preferably in a “hiding place” as opposed to out in the open.

*Figure 175: Image of a Whirlpool Dancer chasing after the player. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

 

### Shion (Snail Slug Monster)
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1fea948-6c0b-488d-99d1-7d9e7f71407d)
*Figure 176: Image of a Shion crying in the darkness. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Shion is constantly crying and whimpering, usually in place in its most common form. Rarely it can wander the halls as a wandering form that acts just like the stationary form but actually moves its locations. As it is blind, it won’t react to your flashlight or any other light sources that you may turn on. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0926d7b1-00e6-4621-b31e-f0dac0ca30d7)
*Figure 177: Image of a Shion crying in the light but as they are blind not detecting the player at all. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*
 
The Shion is entirely blind but, on higher level difficulties, can sense your presence if you get too close. From a large radius, it can sense your movements; on the higher difficulties, even something as simple as walking normally will trigger this Apparitions attention and they will come to verify and check where you are. If you run while in the radius of these Apparitions, you will initiate a chase, and these entities will run extremely fast. Your only hope of escaping one is to quickly use a firecracker to cover your own movements and flee as far and fast as you can. You’ll likely need to throw several firecrackers at higher levels behind yourself to keep its attention drawn just long enough to lose it. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d546a9-35b0-42f5-bc93-4a0514421f48)
*Figure 178: Image of a Shion up close and from a side angle of its whole body. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Shion naming is due to the flowers that grow out of its head in some ways, though these flowers have the same effects as Hydrangea Flowers and will actually cleanse your corruption within a certain radius for the player. These flowers are called Aster tataricus, or the word “Shion” in Japanese. In the language of flowers, this means, “I won’t forget you.” This implies that perhaps the apparition crying is due to being forgotten. Alternatively, it can also be interpreted that the name “Shion” in Japanese for females is a name that means “A person who remembers, one who does not forget.” This could explain why they are crying, for they remember something horrible and it torments them; based on the trauma apparition, this is likely another hint at the linkage to the main character. Shion can also mean “Purple Garden.”, which relates to the flowers and colorations on them. All of these things, can be true at once and lead to the Apparition you see before you and could explain why the character even has some resemblance to the main character. 

### Mizuchi (Snake Woman)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65dd9aef-1b31-4ed7-b897-6141544f1774)
*Figure 179: Image of a Mizuchi apparition in black and white from the front view. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Mizuchi is a unique Apparition as it has no unique sound until it has found you, in which case it will scream at you in a woman’s shrieking voice. If you have light sources around you flickering and your heartbeat is ringing out, this means that a Mizuchi is nearby. You must get to cover to hide as they can both see and hear you under the right circumstances. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be051b73-2fd5-49f6-8371-c769cb7aac66)
*Figure 180: Image of a Mizuchi apparition’s outline with the clairvoyance item activated. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


 
If the Mizuchi  senses a loud enough noise, will borrow underground in which case, it’s presence cannot be heard or even seen at all. Not even your heart beats will go off. They will then emerge from the ground to scare you and chase after you after this occurs. This means that if you are in the clear sometimes, you are not always. 

The best way to deal with a Mizuchi, is to stun them and run into cover, preferably a hiding spot, as fast as possible. If you fear you can’t make it to a hiding spot, stun them and throw fire crackers to avoid being caught and discovered, buying you enough time to make it to safety. 

In Japanese mythology, "mizuchi" (蛟, 虯) refers to a type of aquatic, dragon-like, or serpent-like creature, often associated with water and sometimes considered a water spirit or deity. Which is what this Apparition is based upon. 


### Mechanical Doll 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847f0953-7308-425d-b96c-e61c7a256e9f)
*Figure 181: Image of a Mechanical Doll appariton chasing the player. Image Taken From: https://img.wiki3.jp/shadowcorridor2amanoyohira/kikainingyou.jpg*


The Mechanical Doll Apparition only appears in The Shrine corridor and they will only begin to wander around or chase after you if you walk into their searchlights from their eyes or trigger the map gimmick, depending on the difficulty you are playing on. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66044c1a-11d9-40c8-a4f1-9b12be37afc6)
*Figure 182: Image of a dormant Mechanical Doll shining out its searchlight from its eyes, waiting for a player to walk into its light. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Mechanical Doll can be shot and stunned by gunfire but will not make any indication aside from stopping its movement that it’s been hit. Additionally, they will not react to the sound of your running but will react to screaming Hanging Men, as well as firecrackers, which you can use to your advantage to draw them away. If they see you, however, they will pursue you at all costs. 
 
### Haikara (Stylish, Megaphone Heads)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1bd9d32-0742-46bb-94b1-5916381f19b7)
*Figure 183: Image of a Haikara frozen in time and appearing to seem like it's pointing in black and white. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The first thing you will hear is a type of crazed chattering through a filtered technological windpipe of some kind. These are the sounds produced through the megaphone. While it is within hearing distance of the player, it will start to build up your “insanity” gauge. Causing major issues if you end up not being able to find cover. As if you scream by becoming “frenzied,” you will be discovered and likely lose a Cande Light (Life Point). 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc916f8f-0f71-49cc-b4aa-b3c008b7dbb1)
*Figure 184: Image of a Haikara walking away from the player as it's not spotted them yet. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Haikara, due to their lack of heads, are considered “blind” to an extent in that they won’t usually react to light sources at all. However, they will “see/sense” you if you can be found within a straight line and their ability to sense you will increase if you have light sources up other than the Butterfly Lantern. 

The Haikara are a type of stylish, Eurocentric Japanese clothing that were popular in the Meiji period ( 1868-1912) of Japanese culture. Emperor Meiji, in Japanese culture, is seen as an Emperor who took their traditions and kept the nation as its nation while still modernizing it and embracing some of its European traditions. In the context of this Apparition, it could mean two possibilities. It could simply be a note of their fancy-looking Europeanized clothing, as well as the Apparitions location in “The Glass Building” in normal circumstances, which is a fancy large corridor in itself. Alternatively, it could be a critique of a time in which the Japanese changed drastically and became more Europeanized. This is a Japanese criticism that is primarily directed at Americans.

### Mayubo (Cocoon, Baby Faces) 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef1d9d5-fb4f-4844-957e-2b752eee4d07)
*Figure 185: Image of a Mayubo facing the player, crying out with its baby face. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Mayubo will start attached to a Magatama, like a parasitic organism. It will be inside a large blood-red tumor-looking growth on the ceiling that is attached to the Magatama. It will not activate and burst out this tumor unless you pick up the Magatama. This tumor is likely a “cocoon,” hence, its name of Mayubo, which is a name which means “Cocoon” due to the Kanji: 繭

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fbbadc2-502d-4322-92e4-543a327babea)
*Figure 186: Image of the cocoon a Mayubo was previously in before it burst open. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Once it has emerged, it will cry loudly with the face of a baby and pursue you. It is a fast Apparition and can instantly break down doors. Your best bet is to have means to stun it, such as a gun and then to flee as fast as you can. Once you have escaped its range and your heartbeat returns to normal, The Apparition will curl up on the ground, running out of lifeforce and die there. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2042b3f-f1de-4f07-9a31-c09175a9c9fd)
*Figure 187: Image of a dead Mayubo due to the player escaping it. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*



### Trauma
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7684316d-da21-4db3-adad-d3dd5abd68de)
*Figure 188: Image of Trauma chasing after the player. Image Taken From: https://img.wiki3.jp/shadowcorridor2amanoyohira/torauma.jpg*

The trauma will be heard by its crazed loud sounds approaching you, grating and noticeable from far away; it can distinctively be heard louder than any other Apparition in the game. They resemble, in some ways, the main player yet appear when the text is displayed that says: “You fell a darkness within you….” While the character looks like themselves, the dress and slight detailed differences imply that it might instead be that of the “mother” of the main character instead. 

This Apparition is the most deadly in the entire game; as if you barrier it on the higher modes, it will multiply. Yet worse, no matter where you are, even if you hide, it will be able to find you. From the moment it spawns until the very end, it will rush at you from any distance away and pursue you endlessly. The only way to be rid of a Trauma for good, is to use a Two-Hole Candle, costing you a Cande Light (Life Point) to permanently erase them from the level. As if they grab you and take one life themselves, they will still be present and pursue you yet again in your next life. 
If you go to the Butterfly Shop, The Trauma will not follow you. Instead, it will be teleported to the “exit” and await your leaving of the Butterfly Shop. The moment you leave, it will begin its pursuit, pathfinding you until it reaches you or is removed. 

Another thing you should never do is use a barrier without a teleport out, as the Trauma will way for you outside. If the barrier room you used only has one way inside, the only way out is through the Trauma, which means losing your Candle Light (Life Point) anyway. 

### Shadow of Shinshi (Boss)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f05c2a2-64c0-44ed-a993-77edb28e89f7)
*Figure 189: Image of The Shadow of Shinshi boss chasing after the player. Image Taken From: https://img.wiki3.jp/shadowcorridor2amanoyohira/shinsinokage.jpg*


The Shadow of Shinshi is a godlike entity that is story explained to be your “other half.” An abandoned half that has been left within the realm in which you reside. For this reason, it feels rage toward you due to how long it’s been isolated and left to the corrupting forces that live amongst the realm of the dead. 

The boss only appears on the Missing Windhole level and will pursue the player throughout the level as a chase corridor. You will damage it by blowing up or shooting barrels. You can blow up the barrels without shooting them with a pistol by using firecrackers. The Boss must be close enough in range to take the explosion damage, stunning them for a time and allowing you a chance to escape. 

If you try to put a barrier down on the map to block its path, it will destroy the barrier and then continue its pursuit. If you make it to the end of the level and use the mirror to transport you back to an area similar to the start of the level, you will find The Boss will return by seeping out of the ground behind you. The same will occur if you are captured by it and lose a Candle Light (Life Point) in earlier parts of the chase itself.
 
## Pests
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a041b974-9c63-4636-8296-1993093a0214)
*Figure 190: Image of Cocoon Moth Pests swarming the player. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

Pests are enemies that won’t outright kill you right away but can deal damage to your total health as well as affect various other aspects of your character and the game. At the same time, a pest won’t instantly kill you like an Apparition will; if you're left in a bad situation, they could be largely responsible for giving you a game over or taking one of your lives. 

Some can seal your karuta, some can slow you down, a pest is “an annoyance” but combined with an apparition together, could result in the loss of your life, or worse, an entire run’s failure if the wrong karuta ends up sealed.



### Pest Types

#### The Hanged Man
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4e8fba0-02db-44c7-a942-e69bfc55b2f2)
*Figure 191: Image of a Hanged Man that has just burst out of the ceiling. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Hanged Man can be sticking out of the ceilings of enclosed buildings in corridors and will then proceed to jumpscare the player, causing great sounds and disturbances and doing damage to what it touches. It will also cause loud amounts of noise, which can attract Apparitions. 

#### Spiders
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19489772-650e-44e2-86bb-7f742e14738f)
*Figure 192: Image of Spiders on the ground blocking the player's access to a door. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Spiders lay webs on the ground, waiting for their prey to step inside, slowing them down. Apparitions are unaffected by the web, but players will be slowed down extremely and will suffer damage for every second they are on the web.

#### Human Cocoon Moth
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9506b545-a44c-45d1-ae30-478a5dbfad44)
*Figure 193: Image of Cocoon Moth Pests swarming the player. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Human Cocoon Moths, like the spiders, lay on top of human cocoon remains amidst the corridors and, when triggered by getting too close to them, will chase the player, doing damage to them constantly until they escape or a certain amount of time passes. If a player stands still on their cocoon base location, they will take damage until they lose a life or receive a “Game Over.” 

The alternative version of these are the moths that fly in the room of the Cocoon Moth Trap Room, which guards a Magatama.


#### A Glimpse of The Past (Snails)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7b1395-e361-41af-b1e2-56a6ecbfbefa)
*Figure 194: Image of Snails glowing in the darkness in a faint dark blue color. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

When approached, walked over, or scared, The Snails will spew out a purple mist that covers a large area of a corridor and will build up the player's corruption meter until they escape its large purple radius, or they die. The radius bypasses walls and is determined in a circular radius from where the smoke is emitted from.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f32d9dc-da07-4828-a7d1-544ddd70ad8d)

*Figure 196: Image of the corrupting gas boundary and how it would appear to the player when you escape it. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*



#### Corrupted Humans (Impure) 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/110681c5-4af9-43fd-89ae-ce7549e7d4ae)
*Figure 197: Image of a Corrupted Human from its back where its glowing darkness is fainter. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*



Corrupted Humans (Impure) will grab the player if contact is made and you will have to hit the button for breaking out repeatedly to get free. They can also end up sealing a karuta at a very high chance if you aren’t lucky. If you shoot one or throw firecrackers at it and have them explode, they will disappear.

# Magatama Rooms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f347460b-b539-43fb-880f-d5a4a3acbc17)
*Figure 199: Image of a Magatama behind a door and windows. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Magatama  Rooms are rooms in which you can find Magatama. These rooms are usually behind locked doors, which will require a key to unlock. On higher difficulties, even if taking a Magatama from a room without any traps, the corridor’s effect maybe be triggered on each one’s pick-up. Moreover, on deluge, picking up a Magatama will cause an amount of buildup of corruption, which may even kill you if you pick it up and you had enough corruption prior to picking it up. Causing a “Game Over” or loss of a life. 


## Standard Room: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff30f27b-47c4-4e9d-b704-2e37b63b4df7)
*Figure 200: Image of a Magatama behind a locked door. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

These are standard locked rooms that have a Magatama  to be picked up within. Picking up the Magatama  will grant you it. 
   



## Hole Room

Hole Rooms are locked Magatama  Rooms that require a key to unlock. A large hole is in the middle of them that you can fall into. By falling into the hole, you will suffer health damage similar to trapdoors, but instead of being teleported to a location associated with the trapdoor, you will be teleported to an area below ground.

*Figure 202: Image of a mirror teleport that will lead outside of the hole now entered. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

The Magatama will be on a small altar, and behind it, in the opposite direction, will be a mirror. This mirror will not work like The Butterfly Shop mirrors and will instead teleport you to a random location within the level itself.

**Note: If you drop into the hole without 50 health, you will die and lose a life or be given a “Game Over”.**  

## Trap Room

*Figure 204: Image of a Mayubo in its cocoon attached to the Magatama. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Unlike most other Magatama Rooms, Trap Rooms are usually open unless on Deluge difficulty in some instances. You can tell a room is a trap room, based on a red line that will be attached to the Magatama like an umbilical cord. Once the Magatama is taken from this cord in the room, a baby monster apparition will be spawned and chase you down until you lose it or you die, costing you a life or a “Game Over” if you are out of them. These rooms are easy to access but at a very high reward.

## No Noise Shion Trap Rooms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c95d5611-5120-4798-9669-1778a39578ca)
*Figure 205: Image of a Shion crying behind a door, guarding a Magatama. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*

In many instances, these rooms will be heard, not found right away. The flicker of lights will begin, and so will the distinct sound of crying. Usually, this indicates a Shion guarding these rooms and the Magatama, which is within the room. These rooms can be locked but there are easy workarounds to this fact. 

By throwing firecrackers, you can draw the slug creature away from the Magatama safely without any major risks. It can also result in the apparition breaking down a locked door and allowing you to safely enter inside. If you try to approach the Magatama without drawing the slug creature away, you will most likely enter up, triggering its proximity, in which it will never stop chasing you until it has taken a life from you or caused you to get a “Game Over.” Due to the fact this entity is attracted by footsteps and sounds, its sensitivity is dependent on the difficulty you are playing on.

## Swamp Trap Room
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7a80e1-5c21-4023-a5c0-ea89bb703e1e)
*Figure 206: Image of the entrance to a swamp Magatama room. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Swamp Trap Magatama  Rooms are rooms that are entirely covered on the floor in water. Entering the room will cause corruption to build up, meaning that you must obtain the Magatama fast and then proceed to leave it with the Magatama obtained. On Deluge, these rooms can be extremely deadly without coffee and karuta card negations for corruption as you’ll build up corruption on your way to the Magatama and then proceed to get hit with further buildup that could push it over the edge to cost a life.

## Hanging Man Trap Room

*Figure 208: Image of Hanging Men pests in their respective trap room. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Hanging Man Magatama  Trap Room contains many Hanging Men trap pests, which, when touched will start to flail around and cause issues for your character and deal damage as well as create loud noises that could attract apparitions. The key to these rooms is to carefully try and traverse them or run through them and trigger a few at a time. Once they are triggered, wait for them to untrigger and then that area will remain safe while others could be triggered later. 

These rooms can be major drains on your health and should be very carefully treated as they will drain your health fast if not treated with respect and care. 


## Cocoon Moth Trap Room

*Figure 209: Image of humans that have been cocooned up in the Cocoon Moth trap room. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


Cocoon Moth’s guard this room and the Magatama within. The only way to obtain it is to take the damage of the room or to use a firecracker to scatter the moths, or to use a a star hourglass to freeze time and no damage and run out before its time runs out.

Upon the completion of the corridor level, you will receive a series of medals with a set valuation of points and, from those points, be granted a rating. The ratings consist with the medals unlocked and what are obtained as a result. If enough rating is obtained, you will receive Bonus Magatama for purchasing further karuta cards.

## Ratings: 

Ratings serve as the game’s “stamp” on your performance and will reward bonuses for high enough ratings. The Ratings brackets are as follows below: 

- SS: 24 points or beyond.
- S: 15-23 points 
- A: 12-14 points
- B: 9-11 points. 
- C: 6-8 points.
- D: 3-5 points. 
- E: 2 points and below

SS rating is considered “perfect” and the highest rating you can achieve. E is the lowest, while in practice it is “D” as “E” is extremely hard to obtain in game without trying to obtain it deliberately.

Demonstration: To obtain an E Rank, you must follow these rules.
- Complete the level AFTER 40 minutes.
- Be heard by Apparitions more then two times.
- Take 100 Health Damage total. 

And not break more then two of these rules: 

- Complete the level after traveling below 3KM but more then 1KM (1.1KM and above but now anything past 3KM)
-  Eat no more then 4 rice balls or more then 2 popsicles in a row
-   Consume no passive items
-   Turn on no more then 19 light sources but having at least one on
-   Give away no more then 2 Impurties (Corrupted Humans)
- Drive away pests no more then 2 times
- Stop the Appariton no more then 2 times and same with the pistol
- Spend no more then 2499 souls at the shop
- Be killed if you take the Magatama from the Mayubo
- Not use firecrackers in a cocoon moth room
- Use firecrackers to ensure that the Shion goes somewhere in the No Noise Shion Trap Rooms
- Be discovered before taking a magamata.
- Do not destroy a door or have an Apparition destroy a locked door.
- Do not use trapdoors to make an Apparition fall.
- Do not cremate an Apparition with The One Hole Candle.
- Do not trap an apparition in a barrier or the Trauma,
- Do not escape a wander a single time. 

The above scenario is POSSIBLE… but is more of a challenge than something likely to occur. 

To see your rating on each difficulty and at each level, on the corridor select menu, look where the letters are circled to see your best results.

## Bonus Magatama 

Based on your rating obtained in the level, you will then be granted a set bonus amount of Magatama to be spent for Karuta or anything else you desire. 

- SS = 6 Bonus Magatama. 
- S = 5 Bonus Magatama.
- A = 4 Bonus Magatama
- B = 3 Bonus Magatama
- C = 2 Bonus Magatama
- D = 1 Bonus Magatama
- E = 0 Bonus Magatama
 
# Archives (Collectible Documents) 

Archives are documents that can be collected throughout your explorations that contain information and lore about various aspects of the world in which you find yourself in. They are usually discovered in drawers while searching for items or can be bought at The Butterfly Shop.
 

 

# Magamata Challenge
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e142a1-1b84-4640-b105-3fe83b2dab9c)
*Figure 214: Image of the player's Magatama trophies location. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


The Magamata Challenge is unlocked after completing the entire story fully on any difficulty. The goal of the mode is to grab as many Magamata as fast as possible within the time limit. You start with 5 minutes and every time you obtain a Magamata, you are given an additional minute for your run time. Focusing on speed, as such, is essential. 

Every three Magamata you obtain will grant you a trophy in the following bracket: 

- Gold Trophy: 9
- Silver Trophy: 6
- Bronze Trophy: 3

The map is 4 x 4, and in total, 16 Magatama were generated at once to collect. Health and lives (Candle Lights) still count in this mode. However, you don’t take a direct time penalty for losing a life, aside from the death and respawn animation time itself to the timer. 
Item appearance rates are based on beginner mode.

The conditions for activating the map gimmick when obtaining the Magatama are the same as in the advanced mode but the range of effect of the gimmick is the same as that of the intermediate mode.

The enemy's performance is based on the intermediate level, and the enemy plays at that level as a result. However, the trauma will spawn on any map regardless of its gimmick after a 9th magamata is obtained and it will multiply if put in a barrier, just like in Advanced mode.

# Marathon Mode
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/414a647d-4fa9-4102-8d70-1da552da2aa3)
*Figure 216: Image of where to access the Marathon gamemode. Image Taken By: Steven Grevera*


To unlock Marathon Mode, you must fully complete the story of the game once, and in doing so, you will unlock this mode. 

In Marathon Mode, you start on the first level at the difficulty of your choice and play from start to finish. If you quit the mid-marathon run on the pause menu, resuming will bring the player back to the start of the corridor they were running when they return. This also allows you to change karuta for each individual map for optimal play, as well as coffee effects. If a Game over is obtained, the Marathon is considered “over,” and you must start all over again. 

Souls and items carry over from one corridor into the next, so exploring a corridor for longer periods of time to prepare for the next one might be a possible play to make. 



At the end of your Marathon (if you make it that far-), your total time is totaled up and scored accordingly.
