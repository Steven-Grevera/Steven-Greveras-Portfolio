# Part One: General Information

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 About the Exam

The AP World History: Modern exam is designed by multiple committees of college expert AP level teachers and tests how well you have absorbed information as a high school student doing a first-year college-level course. The course is sanctioned by the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program. The exams will determine whether or not you have a college-level historical examination ability and will, as such, advance you through your journey in college earlier. 

### 1.2 Structure of the Exam

In total, the entire exam lasts 3 hours and 55 minutes and is broken up into four different parts lasting different lengths of time. Of those parts, there are two sections. Section one is parts 1 and 2, and Section Two is parts Three and Four. Traditionally, between Sections I and Sections II is a small break of 10 minutes for a snack and some downtime before moving on to the next section. No student may move ahead of the testing group and must wait patiently should they finish ahead. 

- The first portion of the exam is a series of 55 questions in which you are given 55 minutes for the entire section. Meaning that the best course of action would be one minute maximum on each question to have enough time to successfully get through them all. These questions can consist of any of the following:

  * Questions usually appear in sets of 3–4 questions.
    
  * Students analyze historical texts, interpretations, and evidence.
    
  * Primary and secondary sources, images, graphs, and maps are included.

- The second part of section one is the short answer portion. In this portion, you will be asked to write your answer down in your testing booklet. You will be tasked with analyzing historical sources, interpretations, or propositions. Sometimes questions will include images or maps. Questions 1 and 2 are required and consistent for each and every student, whereas for your third and final question, you will be asked to pick between two different questions and only one. Questions 1 and 2 will contain historical sources for you, whereas the final two will have no sources at all. You will have 40 minutes for this part, so ideally, you will want to spend around 13 minutes on each question to leave any extra time over for the next question. In case some are easier for you than others.

- The first part of Section Two begins with 7 DBQs, in which you have an hour to respond to each. Ideally, as such, you will want to spend 8 minutes on each document which will leave 4 minutes for you to spend on any documents that might give you trouble.

- The second and last part of Section II and the final part of the entire test is the long essay. This essay you will write is usually in the form of a prompt and you are given a choice between 3 different prompt choices. You are given an allotted time limit of 40 minutes. The prompts given are never known beforehand, and as such, you should be ready for anything for this section. This is where your studying will really pay off the most.

### 1.3 Scoring
Your final overall score is based on a scale of one – five. One being the worst and five being the best. The multiple choice questions are scanned into a machine and graded accordingly based on your bubble fills ins. The written questions are checked by different AP teachers and collegiate staff. The scoring percentages for each part are as follows: 
- Part I counts for 40% of your total score (55 multiple choice questions).
- Part Two counts for 20% of your score (3 short form answers.)
- Part Three counts for 25% of your score (7 DBQs.)
- Part Four counts for 15% of your score (Long Form Essay).

### 1.4 Test-taking Tips and Strategies
- Use study guides and practice tests. 
  * In our case, luckily, we have both provided in this booklet for you. Study guides are a key way to gain information but also to practice potential test questions for the test. This should be your primary form of studying as it is far faster to study using guides than the entire textbooks themselves. 


- Read this more than once. 
  * When it comes to studying, don’t read everything one time and call it there. Read it all multiple times. So, for example, if you don’t remember a section by heart, read it once, then go back to it. Each time you do so, you should retain more and more until the point that when your studying, you find yourself skipping as you just know it all by heart. Aim for this for all sections. 

- Study Breaks
  * The brain needs time to rest. You cannot study nonstop without a break and hope to retain all of the information. However, taking too many or too long of breaks can also make you run out of time. The best course of action is to find that perfect happy middle between breaks and studying, and for each and every student, that is something that must be found out on your own. 

## Chapter 2: Foundations

### 2.1. Governance

Throughout history, you will find a diverse set of government systems for peoples and nations both alike. Even in the eras in which “nations” were but instead “tribes,” there was always a “way to do things.” A system in place in which all would follow in thought, for the betterment of themselves, yes but also the whole of the group. 

From the earliest hunter-gathering societies to what we would deem to be “refined” governance in the form of democracy and all its forms, history shows paths that humans would gravitate toward, and this would result in how they would thus so be governed. 

Despite the passing of time and the prevailing view of the global order coming to view Democracy/Republicanism as the primary form of governance, it is best while going through your studies to try and come at things from an objective lens. This is not perfect, of course. All individuals will have their preferences; however, you must not allow that to blind you to the simple truth; all government styles and types have their advantages and disadvantages. We must also realize that while some ideologies and thus governments they spawned as such may be viewed as “repulsive, evil,” in fact, that history is the written accounts of the past. Not what we wished to happen. Only what did factually happen in our human history. 

The Hunting Gathering society’s primary advantage is that by living close to nature, humans are at their most “natural.” As such, biologically speaking, many humans will be psychologically the most at peace they have ever been. This is why at a very early level, women were considered just about equal to men in many ways. Society was broken down by biological lines, and none were viewed as higher or lower than the other. A major disadvantage of this society came in terms of scalability. The Hunting Gathering society was much like a tribe in many ways; as such, many viewed themselves as a family or extended family. The moment that “the other” came into existence outside of that, combat was only natural from then on. So thus so, from that weakness was born the next government type. 

Despotism: Always throughout history, you will find “the strong man.” The man who finds themselves powerful, above and most of all: Should be in charge. Naturally, as such, came the despotism government style. The idea that once would rule above all others. One major advantage of this system is that it’s fast.  On a whim, the supreme leader, with the mere snap of their fingers, could commit any action they liked. Whether righteous or otherwise. Which, in turn, would also bring us to its disadvantage. With the wrong kind of human being in this position, with the snap of their fingers, atrocities could be committed. Worst still, the position was always revolving based on who was the “strongest.”  And so, building on the previous two examples, came another government. One to try and remedy both situations. 

Monarchy/Dynasty Style Governments: Throughout all of Europe and Asia arose two types of governments that, while they had differences culturally when boiled down to their basic components, followed the same style. No longer was the “strongest” the leader; now, it was determined by “nobility” or “royalty.” Using religion as source of guidance and through the indoctrination of societies citizens/subjects were made to believe their leaders and eventually even their successors were not just powerful but also righteous in their rule. As such, the primary benefit to this government was the same as despotism, only without the con of it being a form of “revolving door” leadership. Even so, in practice, this was still the case behind closed doors, as elements of the government would constantly scheme to achieve the throne. Even so, it occurred at a less often rate than the rule of a “strong man” only style of government. The primary con, however, of this style of government for the leaders themselves came from the very pro that was supposed to keep them in power. Family. Oftentimes, arguments would emerge between the family, and relations would become strained. So, while in theory, leadership ascension should have been simple, in reality, behind the scenes, it tended not to be.

Republic: Another type of government system came in the form of something of an amalgamation of everything we had seen already. Building on the concept of Greek City States, they applied that instead now to a larger level. An “empire,” as it were. A central authority that would unite them all. In fact, today, we ourselves in the United States use a mix of both a Republic system but also a Democratic one alike. A major benefit to a Republic system is that while there are many bickering and arguments throughout history when humans are tried and tested, they come up with the best innovations. This was also the first time that each of the “city-states” were represented in a way in which they all had “theoretically” equal power in the form of the Roman Senate. A major con of this system is that it runs extremely slowly. By design, in many cases, a Republic is meant to be slow to ensure everyone gets their side represented or, at the very least, “the majority.” However, this means in times of crisis, should something need to be acted upon in a fast manner, a Republic might be found wanting, or at the very least, should that “executive” exist within The Republic, they may find their rule to be shaky should they act too fast even in times of a crisis. 

Communism: Born from the fruits of the industrial revolution, brought to light by  Karl Marx, Communism was born. The idea being that in order for an industrial society to prosper, it should and must be The Proletariat (The Laboring Class) who seize and maintain the means of production in the country. Designed as an economic system in which labor would be done, this would, however, morph and evolve into the idea that, instead, this must always be the case at all levels. As such, this economic system would, in turn, eventually morph into a government system in which a command economy was controlled by a leader. A pro of this is that the majority of a country would be linked in terms of “class.” The overwhelming majority would all be laborers of some kind. The con, however, is that, in truth, The Elite would still exist. They would be those who planned the economy and made the governmental decisions. Opponents of this system dare say: That communism solved the issue of poverty by making “everyone” poor, rather than only some. 

Fascism: Fascism takes that concept of “The Other” all the way back from Hunting Gathering Days and cranks it up to its most extreme level. Fascism is a government in which a supreme leader is usually in such a position through not only strength and power but also coming with it comes what they call “racial purity.” This, it argues, creates strong soldiers and a true and ultimate “meritocratic” society but also an entire species. In history, there have only been two examples of this type of society having great power. Those societies were Italy, and it’s more infamous: Nazi Germany of World War II. A pro of this type of system is that, indeed, it does get “the results” that it wishes to achieve. “Strength” through any means. However, the cons are many. For to achieve such things come racial genocide, the genocide of children who are “impure” by their standards, and those standards can be anything. The amount of death, pain, and suffering that must occur in such a system is, without a doubt, fascism's greatest con. 

Democracy: A rather new invention in which most societies in our modern era have tried to adopt in some form. However, in truth, no society has successfully adopted a pure form of Democracy, or a “Direct Democracy” as it’s come to be called. For example, our own United States is a hybrid of both the Republic system and the Democratic system alike. Democracy, in essence, is the belief that for every living soul, they shall have a voice. One vote. This turns power instead of a might versus right battle that occurs with every other system, instead, into a battle of the mind. A battle of arguments. Power is achieved, in essence, from convincing people rather than pointing weapons at them. A major pro to this is that under a Democracy comes great power in each and every one of its citizens. For its leader and many decisions as such are chosen by that of the citizens themselves within that society. A major con of this, like the Republic, is the speed at which it operates but at an even greater level. It also, however, comes in the form of the “tyranny of the majority.” For in a true direct democracy, any issue is on the table to be voted on by the people. Any and each will come down to a vote, and the majority thinking idea will come out on top. That doesn’t always mean “the morally right” idea. 

### 2.2.	Geographic Orientation

Geography, while it may seem at first unimportant in the grand scheme of things, is actually critical to all cultures and nations. Does your nation sit in a desert? You might have water issues, and so issues may arise with the water supply that requires far more advanced solutions. Giant bodies of water separate you, and where do you want to go? Is this the end? Heavens, no, let’s make a boat! Such as the Chinese “Junk,” as it was called.

One such example of the key to geography is how humanity was even able to get to the Americas. Using The Bering Land Bridge from Asia, it is thought that walking across it led those in Asia to the Americas today, which resulted in the Native Americans as we know them today living here among many other different groups of people all across the two Americas. This is a key example of the role of geography, for today, The Bering Land Bridge is long since gone. In fact, in the ancient past, it wouldn’t even have been called a “land bridge”; it would have just been a part of the land.

Tectonic plates across the world slowly shift and change, moving land masses across the world. It is thought, in fact, that once we were a supercontinent of everything together. Slowly, however, that began to break apart, which resulted in many of the different human cultures being split up. 

As we move along in this guide, always take some time to immerse yourself in the geography. It doesn’t have to be long but truly let your brain comprehend the sheer differences between your household compared to the culture you are trying to study. It will make things far easier as you go along. 

### 2.3. 	Cultural Developments and Interactions

From even the earliest times, culture as we know it, even in today's modern era, has always existed in some form or another. From pottery, as we would now call: Art, to forms of songs played on instruments long since out of use, humanity has always been constantly interacting with one another. 

A culture is a set of people that follow a certain lifestyle and, historically, in a context of not having our world wide web yet, would tend to be close together. In modern times, this tended to culminate in the form of a nation, but it started smaller in the forms of “tribes” or even just single families and single huts. 

A society comes to “culture:” in two different forms. One form is independent innovation or rather things that they came up with on their own and started mostly with them. Whereas the other form is called “diffusion.” This form comes from things borrowed from (or even taken in the instance of conquered tribes and nations) other cultures and mixed into their own. 

One of the most important cultural aspects of any given culture is its language and written word. For without their written word, of course, would come not any history. Would come not even this very guide that you are reading. 

Many cultures as well came up with their own belief systems known as: “Religion.” Many of them still find their practices today as well. Religion is “the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.”. Of each religion would come a personal history of its people that have practiced it. Below shall be a summary of key aspects of said religions. Religions have two forms of belief systems. Polytheistic, which means that they believe in multiple gods, and then Monotheistic, which means that they believe in only one god. 

Hinduism: Previously known as “Vedism,” Hinduism was its coming successor. It teaches that all beings have a soul that wishes to become reunited with a greater and ultimate “World Soul.” Vedism brought into place a caste system, believing that all living souls are reincarnated after death in the form of the birth of another being. Thus so, they believed that should you die justly, and as a good follower, you would be promoted in the caste higher in ranking. They called this: Dharma (Karma as we call it). The most righteous of which attaining the title of “The Elite” and those of evil deeds being born as “The Untouchables.” Hinduism is a polytheistic religion believing in several gods. Their most notable: are Brahma, The World Soul, and personified as a male. Vishnu The Preserver, Shiva The Destroyer, and their great goddess: Shakti. 

Buddhism: Created in a great schism from Hinduism, Buddhism was created by a man known as “The Buddha.” Once one of the “Elites,” The Buddha saw the suffering of other humans and would come to develop a new set of teachings in a separate religion entirely. Of that come the core Four Noble Truths: “The truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering.” In other words: Suffering exists; it has a cause, it has an end, and it has a cause to bring its end. Like its predecessor, Hinduism, Buddhism believes in the concepts of Karma and Reincarnation. However, they instead argue against the caste system. Believing that any and all can eventually be reunited with the World Soul through accepting and acting upon the Four Noble Truths. 

Confucianism: Created by a man named Confucius as an act of rebellion due to strife of the time period, in his retirement, he came up with a set of beliefs that found followers in China’s early periods. Confucianism cared little for Chinese gods at the time and focused more on ethical and just actions in the living world. The core belief of the religion was that benevolent ruling from above would result in good behavior from those below. Creating a social and perfect harmony for the whole of society. Order and hierarchy are critical, and the good of the many always comes before the good of the one. The idea is that should a ruler rule justly, then the people ruled are obligated to be ruled and behave well under the said ruling. It also set that all of society was one giant family and that it should essentially always respect its elders. On Confucius's death, these teachings were all found in the religion's “holy text” known as the “Analects.” 

Daoism: Daoists seek to achieve harmony with what they call: The Dao, which is their word for: “The Way/Path.” An invisible but irresistible force that governs the whole of the entire universe. Whereas Confucianism is about Order, Daoism could be described as more “chaotic.” They reject the idea of rationality and instead seek more nonlogical means of understanding. The most famous Daoist symbol is that of the Yin and Yang. It embraced things like fortune telling and alchemy, among even the sciences.

Zoroastrianism: Considered to be the first “Monotheistic” religion. Zoroastrians believed that those deemed worthy would go on to assist their god, Ahura Mazda, in his work as the creator of all things good against its ancient evil Ahriman. The religion was thought to have originated in Iran and became a major political force in 500’s B.C.E when Darius the Great used the religion to justify his rule as the supreme and ultimate king of his nation. 

Judaism: The Hebrew people came from that Monotheistic belief structure. Like the Zoroastrians, they believed in a single god. The primary belief system of the Jewish faith is that through the acts advised within The Torah shall come the ascension into the promised land. Those who fail to do so shall be condemned to Hell. 

Christianity: Take all that was said about Judaism and now instead add in Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus taught that caring and compassion were more important than Rabbi (Priests) and societal customs. Christianity was very popular amongst the common folk due to its easy-to-follow and understood beliefs as well as its more “populist” message. However, these teachings would anger the local Jewish government in which the religion came into its existence, and Jesus would end up crucified on the cross. Its follower's believed that he was resurrected and that this man was the son of God. 

Islam: The youngest of the three major monotheistic religions, Islam follows many of the same teachings as Judaism, but instead of Jesus being their primary figure, the Prophet Muhammad instead was their leader.  While meditating in 610 C.E, Muhammad stated that he had heard the words and seen a vision from the Archangel Jibril. Giving him the word of Allah (God). They believe in the Five Pillars of Faith. 

### 2.4.	Technology and Innovations

From the discovery of fire to our modern inventions today, humanity has always been an ever-evolving and ever-growing species. Some of the most notable would be that of metallurgy, which allowed for the transition from basic stone tools to more advanced metal tools that were even used in the form of swords and various other medieval weapons in our C.E timeline. These came into major use in 4000 – 3000 B.C.E. Think of all those millions of years as such in which we as humans had to use nothing more than stone! Iron came at around 1200 B.C.E whereas before; most tools were of bronze make. 

Not only was such an invention for weapons of war, but. Such tools could also be used for farming methods and methods in general, just to make humanity's life more comfortable. The Wheel, an infamous invention, was of great assistance with this as well. 

When looking to the Vikings in their era of time, you can see the true benefit of seafaring at work. Having to travel sea to sea in order to find the various lands which they would conquer and plunder.

The discovery and invention of mathematics, engineering, and improved medicinal techniques improved the average quality and lifespan of humanity as a whole as well. 

While the Printing Press technology was a major innovation, it is must newer than its predecessor. The Woodblock Printing technology came into use in China in the 200s C.E. 

Where humanity found needs and found struggles, humanity would always find a way to improve. This, if nowhere else, can best and always be seen in the things that we as humans have created throughout the many years that we have existed. 

### 2.5.	Economic Systems

Economic systems are as varied and evolving as humanity itself. In the millions of years that humanity has been on earth, so long as there has been something another human can do/obtain that another cannot easily or at speed needed, trade has existed. From the bartering systems of old to the more modern systems of now, economic systems have always existed in some form or another. 

Before 1200 C.E, was Pre Industrial society which tended to be mostly agricultural, pastoral, hunting, and forging style trading. These types of trading eventually led to marketplaces that served as hubs of expected goods for “paying” customers. From these marketplaces, eventually, would come trade routes such as the famous “Silk Road,” which in turn would begin the cultural exchange between the different groups, which led to the spread of religions and various other ideas. 

Coins were developed and invented in the Middle East around the years of 600-500 B.C.E, and paper money/bank notes were invented in China in the years of 600-1100 C.E., Becoming a more currency-based economy rather than the pure bartering system that had been used up to this point. Shortly as well within that time period also came the idea of banking and credit, which inspired more trust-based economics. 

The types of economic systems we have seen through history and that are of note are as follows below:

Bartering: The trade of a good for another good or a set number of varied goods or multiple of one types of good. There is very little division of labor or specialization.

Command Economy: An economy that is dominated and controlled by some form of centralized authority, usually the government or ruler. They plan out the nature of how the economy works and the divisions of labor within it. They react slowly to people's wants and needs traditionally and, as such, tend not to do well in many of the long terms. The most famous form of named distinct Command Economy is Communism. 

Market Economy: Market economies are based on the idea of Free Markets. The idea is that very little government interference will result in markets designed more toward what the actual citizens/economic buyers in the nation want rather than what the government wants per se. The ultimate law comes in the form of Supply and Demand. The idea of the demand for a product and the supply of said product dictate the price and quantity in which the product is sold/moved to different communities and individuals. The most famous named distinct Market Economy is Capitalism. A downside of this system is that it tends to result in certain individuals amassing a great deal of wealth and then, by extension, power. It also gears a market toward what is desired rather than what is “needed,” as the state would define it. 

Mixed System: Most modern nations today use a Mixed System. A Mixed System is a combination of both Market and Command Economies. An example of a mixed system is a heavily regulated market economy or even a middle/semi-regulated economy. As such, almost every economy in the entire world is a Mixed System at this point in time. The idea is by mixing the best of both and cutting out the worst; only the best can come from it. Others would argue otherwise. 

### 2.6.	Social Interactions and Organizations

In our modern-day life, social structures are things we as humans grasp in seconds and give little thought to. The reason being that we are living it day to day at that moment. We know what is and what is not socially acceptable. For the sake of history, however, and going back in time to gleam the gems of the past, we must understand the past social structures and organizations; we much analyze them, and to do so can take some time to achieve. 

The key things to note are as follows: Who exercises power in this structure? Why? That should lead to what a society values. Next, how is labor organized? Do people pick their jobs like in modern capitalist society, or are they thrust into one by the edict of their government? Are they prosperous, or are they in hard times? What role does their social class or gender have in this society? How are they viewed as such? Do they view certain skin colors as different/superior? Inferior? What religion is the dominant one? Is there even one? All these questions and more will give you a window, a lens if you will, into the daily life of how people operate and why they do so. 

Take early humans. Most tended to go into gender roles as, to them, it was biologically natural. No one yet truly knew how to grow food, so women would forage, and men would hunt. That was the way of things, for the most part, and how most societies supported each other. A simple culture led to simple but immense issues. No food this week? You starved. That was it. 

Social classes tended to exist in all societies, even hunting-gathering ones, but they became more complex and varied as time went on in human civilization. One of such changes was the concept of the slave and so also began the slave trade. The idea was that another human being could be subjugated for any reason to do the bidding of whomever their master was. 

How did the society view “The Other,” as in those from outside the nation or those whom they viewed as ethnically different? The Fascists thought such things should be removed by the most disturbing of methods. Other cultures embraced their diversity. Though, that mostly hasn’t happened until our modern era. Still, some levels of comfort came to certain groups that didn’t exist elsewhere. For example, in Islam, it is said that women, at the time of the founding of the religion, had a more equalized lifestyle as opposed to other religions. The question then becomes, why? Was it by design, or was it by sheer coincidence? Circumstances of the times, perhaps? 

### 2.7.	Humans and the Environment

The tale of the environment and humans is an interesting one. For in truth, we want from being dictated by the environment to living with it and then conquering it in our modern times. To the point now where we can influence the environment to such a degree that we can cause what now has come to be known as “Man Made Natural Disasters.” 

While during the time of our human hunting-gathering eras, the environmental effects were still there, the unintended consequences of those actions were minor compared to the consequences of today. 

One such consequence that was done in our early history was the result of the domestication of animals. By choosing artificially the animals which we preferred, we caused them to both thrive but to also evolve in such a way to benefit us. Take, for example, The Dog. Man’s best friend, as they call them. 

Later, as our methods of resource extraction became more intense, so too did the damage to the general area as well. Our biggest damages to the world came in the form of species extinction, deforestation, and erosion. 

# Part Two: c. 1200 to c. 1450

## Chapter 3: The Global Tapestry (8-10% of the test)

### 3.1 Developments in East Asia

During this time period in East Asia, the main thing to truly focus on and talk about was the dominance of the powerhouse that was China’s Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty was a massive and powerful Chinese dynasty (Empire). 

Confucianism had become the dominant ideology of this time period in the dynasty and with it came all of its beliefs. In this time period, not only was the Song Dynasty the most powerful East Asian nation, it could have been considered the strongest nation on the whole of the planet in terms of power, influence, size, trade, and military. 

So vast and powerful was its empire that it began to spread to every neighboring region, dominating all of East Asia. One of those ideologies to spread from Confucianism was gender roles. Respect for women but the idea that they were to also have deference. 

Citizenship in this Dynasty was determined by The Civil Services Exam. The Civil Services Exam essentially would determine your future and success within the Song Dynasty, as through the Civil Services Exam, you could go from being an average citizen to becoming a government official. This led to an interesting change of the status quo in which government power was now led by the educated and those who passed the exam, rather than by military might dominating all positions of leadership. The primary thing that you needed for The Civil Services Exam was a heavy mastery of Confucianism texts and knowledge. This would tend to lead to a higher ranking in the Song Dynasty. As time went on, the exam would become more and more open as it was seen as such a path forward to success. 

Economic production increased drastically in this time period, and a key economic resource was textiles and silk.  

Environmentally Champa rice was created, and their plants spread throughout all of East Asia for the economic purposes of the Song Dynasty. It kept the citizens of the Dynasty well fed, so much so that they could even afford to export it elsewhere for trade.

### 3.2 Developments in Dar al-Islam

Dar-Al-Islam, or “The World of Islam,” covers not only the middle east but also parts of Africa. However, in truth, Islam cares not for things such as national borders and views its people instead as more of a global body. They call this the “Ummah.” An Arabic word for “Community” is our best English conversion. Islam will be a present factor in all remaining chapters, but for this chapter, the primary focus is the greater whole of Islam itself.

Islam spread greatly in this time period through military conquest but also through Sufi Mystics bringing in converts to the religion. They would grant a jizya or rather “tax” to maintain their non-Islamic religion. 

Intellectually the Islamic world was very scholarly and focused on innovation. Innovations were preserved well in various different documented texts, and they are well known to have examined and gleamed their own intellectual forms of philosophers from examining the ancient Greek and roman texts of old. This knowledge would then transfer around the world as the Ummah would migrate, settle or go on various different trade routes across the world. 

### 3.3 Developments in South and Southeast Asia

The region consisting of India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The region saw a triangle of religions leading to many diverse cultures developing within it that didn’t always get along well. This triangle was that of Hinduism, which was the dominant faction. Buddhism, which was bred as a form of an offshoot of Hinduism, as such putting the two in strife with one another in some ways. And lastly, Sufi Islam. 

Sufi Islam and Hinduism could be called the more “Mystical” aspect of the religions and ideologies followed in these regions. At the same time, Buddhism was a mostly “monastic” religion compared to the other two. 

The Khmer Empire, located in present-day Cambodia, was one such Hunduist nation. Historically famous for its buildings to Vishnu and Shiva, it was one of the most powerful nations in the region and was a strong stronghold for the Hinduist religion. 

### 3.4 State Building in the Americas

State building in the Americas primarily consisted of the regions of North America, Mesoamerica, and the Andes Mountains. The beginning of the decline of the Mayan City States had begun, and they had begun to give way to the new rising Aztec Empire. The Inca Empire was also well at hand in development in the Andes Mountains. 

Most cultures in the region were polytheistic, whereas economically, they had no singular Americanized network connecting the different regions together. Instead, most trading and economic affairs were handled at the local and regional levels. 

The Mayan City States deferred from the Greek example as, unlike The Greeks, The Mayans had zero “Federal” government in their history. In other words, they not once in recorded history all banded together united under a single king. Instead, each Mayan City State was ruled over by its own priests and kings, which dictated how the City State would run. 

That’s not to say that they weren’t on the same side or that they were independent. In history, The Mayan Civilization is often referred to as “The Mayan Empire” for a reason. For in truth, while each City State was independent, many had tribute obligations to one another in exchange for security, alliances, and good balanced and safely maintained trade.

### 3.5 State Building in Africa 

Islam spread heavily throughout Africa and tended to be adopted by the elites and then brought downstream to its citizens. These elites wanted to be part of something “higher” and better as well as united, and so they turned to “Dar al-Islam” as this greater world to turn to. They also tried to bring prosperity to their own people through the use and belief in a new god. The god of Islam. Allah. Islam allowed rulers to keep most of their existing practices already in place with some very slow shifts into the more Islam style of rule. 

Something done in Africa was the use of the jizya tax, and this is where it was mostly seen. While other monotheistic style religions were allowed to pay the poll tax, any polytheistic religions (which Africa was heavily pre-Islam) were offered the option of conversion or death. 

Through Islam came the intellectual transfer into Africa of the very technologies that Islamic groups are credited with making, such as mathematics. This many came from the economic trade routes and the Islamic people traveling on them. They brought with them many technologies such as leatherworking and even more advanced metal working as well as the very religion of Islam itself. 

Economically Africa in this time period is not at all the stereotypical view of Africa in our modern times. It was heavily connected economically via various land trade routes and even oceanic routes that were left outside of the continent. One legendary economic powerhouse was the nation of Great Zimbabwe which was one of the top trading nations of the time period.

While Islam played a deep and expanding role in Africa, it should very much be noted that it wasn’t the only religion despite being the most dominant. In fact, the whole of West Africa tended to practice other religions as their dominant as opposed to Islam. West Africa, however, had a very good and peaceful relationship with Islam. To the point in this time period, even the polytheistic religions appeared to be safe from any form of issues. Christianity was also huge in Ethiopia, which even considered itself a “Christian Empire” culturally within Africa. 

### 3.6 Developments in Europe

The story of Europe in this time period is one of division and fragmentation at almost every level and aspect of life. From political to religious, both Europe was heavily divided and extremely diverse in their nations. 

The dominant religion of Europe became Christianity. It was not the only religion, and there were indeed others, but it was the major and dominant one in the religion. 

Religiously, the Christian Religion had been split in half. Becoming that of Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism. The primary difference being in that Catholics looked to their Popes as being below God, yes, but infallible and essentially unquestionable. For lack of any other word, like Gods themselves. At the same time, The Orthodox sect believed that even their Patriarchs were not beyond questioning or scrutiny. This division was so intense that even conflict broke out about it and has even to this very day.


Nationally, Europe has no single “Great Empire” to rule them all. It’s entirely divided and fragmented at every level, with all nations fighting for power and land. They are even divided into local politics and views of leadership within those local areas. 

Economically most of Europe is based on agricultural production and trading. Labor was devised into two different group types. The first is “Free Labor,” which essentially means people are growing/creating their own things for themselves or selling to others. In other words, the only way that we do things now in modern America for the most part. In contrast, the alternative option was called “coerced labor,” which at this time went by the name of Serfdom. 

Serfdom was essentially labor that was forced and not compensated in the form of a wage. Serfdom was the idea that an individual and their whole family line were essentially “indebted” to a Lord, usually of a plot of land or several. As such, they themselves and their children would be working for this Lord as a means to “pay off their debts,” only traditionally, those debts never tended to actually be paid off. Many compare it to slavery, and it’s very close. However, slavery was far more overt and extreme. A slave was seen as “property,” whereas a Serf was still seen as a worker. Just indebted work. 

### 3.7 Comparisons in the Period

Taking all that you have no learned into account, it is a good place to use this time to recap the major comparisons of this world, and you will find there are three key takeaways from it.

Islam: Islamic rule was heavily unified and prosperous as it settled into regions like Africa. Since it was easily accepted by local population leaders firsthand and then slowly trickled down into the people through the use of force and laws, they made many advancements and developed many things. In every aspect, Islam viewed itself as unified, and this can be seen in how they behaved amongst one another. “Dar al-Islam” was truly taken to its literal in many instances in how they ruled and what they did during said rule during this time period. They existed nearly everywhere and were constantly evolving, changing, and thriving where they were found. 

The Free: South/Southeast Asia and The Americas were heavily independent of all other aspects of the world but, above all, were free. While things would get a bit chaotic due to all the religions in South/South East Asia, for example, most groups were allowed to practice this religion as they wished. Whereas in The Americas, in The Mayan system, for example, they were allowed freedom based upon city-states and their rules and laws within them. Freedom of religion in one area and more freedom of laws and governments in another. 

The Empire: East Asia is heavily dominated by a great Empire known as a Dynasty in their cultural use of the word. That being The Song Dynasty. They are a military, economic, technological, and even intellectual powerhouse that has very few rivals. 

The Divided: Europe is scattered, fragmented, and in many ways in turmoil due to the fighting and divisions in religions, political power, and even regal power. Everywhere you go in Europe, everything is divided. Even in the most basic labor sense, there are different classes, and thus so, divisions in Europe between those allowed “free labor” and Coerced Labor. While diversity isn’t always a bad thing, in many ways, this manifested badly in Europe to create great chaos that resulted in many deaths and much damage across the region. Yet despite all of this, the one thing that Europe was not divided in on the world stage was being alone region-wise. Europe is, without a doubt, the most divided in this time period.

## Chapter 4: Networks of Exchange (8-10% of the test)

### 4.1 The Silk Roads

The Silk Roads was a vast and expansive network that spread far and wide. From the North East direction was China, the tips being Beijing and Shanghai. From the North, West tip was the location of Mashhad. Its end in the Southmost direction, and the middle of the road itself came in the name of Patna. The road would go through it toward the Bengal Sea and parts of India itself. In total, the Silk Road consisted of 4,000 miles of road, making it huge. 

In history, the existence of the Silk Roads was a major deal and a huge factor in the path toward modern globalization. It is the most famous trade route, but it is not the only one. This chapter will further explore that later, but for now, The Silk Road itself deserves a substantial amount of time. 

The Silk Roads was primarily a means of transporting high-level regal/more expensive goods across a wide network, which is what made it so famous at the time. If you could dominate the silk road, you essentially had some of the greatest power in the world. However, it was the largest and most secure network out of all of them, so to try and steal from or dominate it would not be an easy task. It got its name as the most common trading commodity on the road was that of Silk itself. 

Religion diffused greatly on The Silk Road and not just one. As expected as a common theme throughout history, Islam did indeed spread through The Silk Road; however, it was not the only one. Christianity and Buddhism as well were very key and heavily diffused religions via the roads and also helped to spread them along in these earlier days. 

However, all was not sunshine and rainbows with this new connectivity that the road allowed. While it was not the only road responsible, the fact is that the Silk Road helped facilitate and diffuse The Black Death throughout the entire world. The Black Death was an extremely deadly disease that could kill at an extremely fast rate, and with technological advancements in medicine being far lower than in our modern time period, the death tolls were rising. 


These death tolls would then turn into great fear. This led to the death of the community and created an anti-community atmosphere in which people attempted to isolate themselves. The issue was due to the primary spreader of the disease actually being rats, a household rodent problem; this only made things infinitely worse. A good way to immerse yourself in the feelings of this time period can honestly be seen at the start of the 2020 Covid19 Pandemic. It was very much the exact same thoughts and feelings of needing to hide and being afraid but much worse as medicine levels were far lower at the time.

### 4.2 The Mongol Empire and the Making of the Modern World

Throughout history, the Mongols have been seen as barbaric savages, but in truth, there is far more to the story than that stereotype. While yes, they indeed were infamous fighters and raiders in the world that were feared for their sheer military dominance as a culture and a people, they were unique in the world. 

The Mongols were a nomadic/pastoralist society that tended to move from place to place and was always on the move. They spread all along Asia in regions such as Manchuria. Persia and Asia would eventually end up linked together through the Mongols and their conquests. 

When actually settling and taking land down, they had a very complex tax system which allowed for major economic benefits to their society as it turned in a hefty profit. It was very structured and systematic, blending well into the economics of all the regions they took. Their economy was so good that they always had a surplus which they, in turn, then used as supplies to fund their war campaigns. They used the Silk Roads not only to travel, but survivors/others who had encountered The Mongols would spread their infamy to other nations via The Silk Roads. Tales, much how they spread the words of their religions. This, in turn, led to nations taking notice and preparing for their invasions in the future. 

Despite this, The Mongols were extremely effective in combat which did the nations which were against it little good. One such tactic they used was throwing the black death in forms of canisters like old-fashioned forms of grenades as well as using larger variants to be catapulted. This was the earliest form of biological warfare to ever be recorded being used. It was extremely deadly and extremely effective at clearing out hostile settlements and completely destroyed the stereotype of them being barbarians and savages. 

The Mongols were very egalitarian as a nomadic people when it came to gender and race. They mixed and blended all the time, and the usual modern-day stereotypical gender roles did not apply. It is theorized, however, by some historians in fact that it was The Mongol’s ruthless military campaigns that led to other nations fearing them, and for a good reason. However, this fear would manifest in such a way, it is why Gender Roles and the Patriarchal system began to take shape in places like Europe and across the world. Essentially, it was a counter-culture to the Mongol egalitarianism that stemmed from fear. So while The Mongols themselves may have been very egalitarian, they arguably extremely hurt women’s rights in the long run. 

The Mongols were also extremely religiously tolerant. Allowing just about anyone to believe in as they wished so long as they served the greater group and didn’t interfere with their missions and goals.

In the end, The Mongols fell due to not being able to secure their land as well as their nature of being Nomads. When times got hard, they picked up and moved to the point they did it so much that essentially everything fell. While in terms of global conquest and dominance, they had a very good run, in the end, they fell to the very same systems that made them so powerful in the first place. 
 
### 4.3 Exchange in the Indian Ocean

The Indian Ocean trade was the largest sea-based trade network to exist for the time period, stretching across huge tracts of the entire planet due to the sea-based nature of the trading. The network, unlike The Silk Road, which was commonly used more for highly valuable items and cost far more, was the polar opposite. Its goods were far cheaper, and its methods for maintaining it were far easier due to its ocean-based nature. It also tended to deal in much higher demands as they sold items in bulk as such, the items being sold had to actually be bulk-style items. 

The Indian Ocean trade route was so successful that it helped to spur the concept of money as well as the creation and idea of the debt and credit system. Also created during and in many parts due to this route were both the compass and astrolabe. 

One major issue with the trade route, however, was that it was heavily controlled by that of Monsoons. Should one occur and hit a trade ship, cargo would be lost, so it was very heavily influencing the route. Route users having to adapt for and compensate for route takers on it. 

Islam made gains through these trade routes, introducing to diaspora communities that would end up becoming Islamic Merchants as well as to the country and people of the Swahili. Rapidly becoming Islamic. 

### 4.4 Trans-Saharan Trade Routes

The Trans-Saharan Trade Routes linked North Africa to the Mediterranean and then finally to that of West Africa. It spanned 1491 miles and had far more environmental variety in terms of regions that the route went through. While smaller than the Silk Roads, it was still an extremely key player in the history shaping of the regions. 

This route completely changed and transformed West Africa by connecting it to larger parts of the world and, as such, also granted it far more valuable resources and introduced it to new ideas, cultures, and beliefs. 

The route was the first to see the use and introduction of The Camal as a means of transporting more goods, similar to what a modern-day tractor-trailer would do today. Carrying many goods in bulk across the route in order to reach their destination. 

The route created further social complexity and brought further globalization to the entire planet but also began to once more further increase the sense of patriarchy and oppression of women seemed to be increasing. As a result of the Mongol raiders and conquests, as discussed previously, women on this route of high rank, wealth, or power were seen as “dangerous.” Which slowly blended into the whole of the cultures connected to the routes as well. 

### 4.5 Cultural Consequences of Connectivity

The consequences culturally of these routes as vast. Diaspora communities, due to these routes, began to forge entirely new identities and found entirely new purposes. Diffusions of religions occurred at far greater rates which brought with them cultures of their own as well. 

Large-scale migrations occurred of the Bantu and Polynesians. Chinese traditions would begin to make it to Japan. You could consider these good or gray consequences.

But something most can agree would be a major con in terms of consequences would be the lowering of the status of women. Spurred on by the Mongols, women would continue to deal with more and more issues, and now, in Islamic-styled nations such as the Persians taking on the Veil for women, which in terms was viewed as subjugation before Allah. 

### 4.6 Environmental Consequences of Connectivity

The creation and maintaining of the routes, as well as the human interactions involved in them, led to the creation of crops just for the routes to be sold on. For example, Bananas were diffused everywhere. However, as things like the compass came more into use, as well as various tools, all of them required metal. This requirement of metal meant that there was more metal needed to be gathered, and so more was gathered as well as mined. This created environmental damage to local ecosystems and areas for the benefit of the metal being obtained. Money economics as well required this as they used metal coins which in turn once more would damage the environment. 

Meanwhile as well, deadly pathogens would spread on the trade routes that would not only kill humans but would also kill many wildlife and even plants. Things such as the Black Death and many other diseases that we don’t even have recorded in history anymore. This will get worse over time as well as come up again in the age of gunpowder. 


### 4.7 Comparison of Economic Exchange

The three routes listed were the most extensive trade routes for the time period and had drastic and everlasting effects on the regions in which they connected. The primary differences come down to the goods that were sold and the types of routes that they were.

The Silk Road: Tended to deal with luxury items, was well secured, and was the biggest of them all. 

The Indian Ocean: Was the first major ocean trade route that was effective and successful. It was the only water one compared to the other two. It also tended to deal with less valuable items and was all about bulk. 

The Trans-Saharan Trade Routes: Tended to deal with the transfer of metals such as gold and were much smaller than the Silk Roads. 


# Part 3: c. 1450 to c. 1750 

## Chapter 5: Land-Based Empires (12-15% of the test)

### 5.1 Gunpowder Empires

With the coming of a new age came the coming of a new type of empire. The age of melee weapons and primary metal-based medieval-style weapons was at an end. A new style of technology to be utilized for warfare was coming to the forefront, and that technology was that of gunpowder-based weapons.

With new technology also came new nations and new cultures that will be discussed further along as we go along. With those also came new belief systems, which justified a newfound belief in expansion and conquest. 

For the most part, with this new and powerful technology, gone were the days of peaceful assimilation and absorption of regions into the nations. Now, the days of conquest had truly racked up, and those without gunpowder would be quickly conquered by those who had it. 

All Gunpowder Empires shared three distinct characteristics. Those were that they always had a large centralized authority and were (usually) a land-based empire. They utilized and prioritized gunpowder for the use of territorial expansion, and then finally, they always had a type of administrative system to amass wealth and thus support their gunpowder-based forces. 

### 5.2 Europe

Gone from the periods of strike and disunity, surviving and resurging after the plagues and the crusades, Europe was in a period of both recoveries but also of true dominance. The Big 5 countries in this region are now countries we know even today. They were: Spain, Portugal, France, England, and The Netherlands. 

Across all European nations, the end of the Feudal System had begun, ending serfdom and its entire concept. 

Across Europe, a common form of dominant ruling style was that of “absolutism.” Absolutism was the belief that: their rule could not be challenged as their rules were ordained by God. They ruled in every aspect possible. 

Christianity, meanwhile, was dealing with the emergence now of a new sect. The Protestant Reformation had begun. Martin Luther, who didn’t believe in the idea that an indulgence (essentially a payment to absolve your sins in the eyes of god and the church) should absolve one of their sins as well as questioned the entire concept of confession as well. He nailed his “95 Theses” onto the wall of a church, and so a conflict had begun between the whole of the religion.

### 5.3 Russia

The Mongol dominance took quite some time to shake off of Russia, but it was Ivan The Great that managed to do so by force. Forcing an end to the Mongol's Indirect Rule style. Orthodox Christianity also became the dominant force in Russia during this time period, and this was even used by Ivan The Great to unite all of Russia behind a common ally, so the speak. 

Ivan The Terrible, however, on the other hand, his son, while arguably doing many great things for Russia, received the nickname due to the method in which he achieved this. Ivan The Terrible took Russia and turned it into a complete and total “Absolute Monarchy.” Proclaiming himself “The Czar” (which would forever more speak of a Russian King as a term), in doing so, Ivan had set up Russia for “Absolute Rule,” which was an extremely forceful and totalitarian method of ruling where anyone who disobeyed was usually brutally killed in savage displays of power. This gave Russia a heavily “savage” appearance and theme during Ivan The Terrible’s reign. 

Ivan The Terrible would attempt to westernize his nation by force. He forced men to shave their beards at great cost if he was deified. He also stole power from Sweden and expanded into Siberia by military force to add to the land. 

Eventually would begin “The Romanov Dynasty.” The Romanov Dynasty was a period in Russia in which several rulers by imperial rule controlled the land of Russia. The Romanov Family was the last imperial power to rule Russia in our modern history as of yet. 

The first of the Romanovs of note was Michael Romanov, who expanded Russia into the Pacific Ocean. He made peace with both Sweden in 1617 and Poland in 1618, rectifying what he viewed as a mistake from Ivan The Terrible. Another of the reasons for peace with Poland may have come from the fact that Michael’s father was in captivity in Poland, and after peace was established, he was released. Michael’s father would become a prominent member of Michaels's court, and together with him now as a form of co-ruler, they achieved many things they would consider reforms. Such as a strengthening of the federal power over the local, dealing with financial issues and debts the nation had incurred, and also strengthened serfdom. Internationally, Michael would increase diplomatic and cultural efforts between Russia and Europe, and this would further westernize the nation. 

Eventually would come Peter; The Great, and with him would come in history what is viewed as Russia’s “Modernization” moments. Peter would make Russia into a great European Power and greatly expanded The Russian Navy. He lessened The Orthodox Church’s power as well. Peter was a perfectionist from a young child all the way into adulthood, so when he inherited the throne and thus the state of Russia, he despised it. While he made it far more powerful and arguably brought it to greatness, he did so through the means of tyranny, and in history, many times through its citizens, Peter is viewed as a tyrant. Peter would go on to have built St Peterburg as he also heavily continued to promote and try and expand “westernization.” 

Eventually, after Peter came Catherine The Great, who many considered to be more “enlightened” than the previous Ivan; however, she was still extremely oppressive toward her people and kept up many of the same systems in which he ruled previously. 

### 5.4 East Asia

When talking about East Asia in this time period, we are mostly talking about two different Dynasties which came back to back. In fact, one Dynasty was the origin of another; that is to say, the second dynasty would not have existed without the destruction of the first. Those two dynasties are both the Ming Dynasty and then the later Qing Dynasty, which occurred afterward. 

The Ming Dynasty was still considered another Golden Age in China. Founded in 1368, The Ming, like the Song prior, were still heavily influenced and based on the idea of Confucian principles and ideologies. They also still administered the Civil Service Exam as part of the rank and file hierarchy-making system of their country and culture. Demand for Ming Porcelain and Silk was massive, which allowed the Ming to dominate and gain much economic power, which they then could turn into funding and expanding The Great Wall. 

Emperor Hongwu elevated the role of Emperor within The Ming Dynasty as its first Emperor. Giving himself more power, and thus, so all subsequent Emperors after him. He removed the position of Chancellor and greatly lowered the power of eunuchs in the country. He also brought up several heavy anti-corruption reforms that some would have even called “draconian” by Chinese standards. 

After Emperor Hongwu came Emperor Yongle, Emperor Yongle tried to open up China to the world by sponsoring expeditions around it. He sponsored an explorer known famously as Zheng He. He also tried to bring about more diplomatic ties and diplomacy around the world. Emperor Yongle would move the capital city to Beijing, where it is today, and also most famously had The Forbidden City built, which stands tall to this very day. 

After the death of Emperor Yongle on August 12, 1424 CE, China became far more isolated, and instead of continuing to look outward, instead began to look inward.  It was during this inward examination of itself that, over the next hundreds of years, a new conflict would begin. 

Inflation had begun to skyrocket due to a large-scale silver influx problem into the country. On top of that, the population increased drastically over the hundred years, and so would come the final nail in the coffin. Lack of food. Due to lack of food, people began to starve, and this fueled a civil war, and in 1644 a peasant revolt began.

In that very same year of 1644, the Manchu soldiers took Beijing, and from within it, they proclaimed a new Emperor. With that Emperor as well, they brought themselves into a new Dynasty now, calling it now: The Qing Dynasty. 

With The Qing Dynasty came many drastic and severe changes to the structure of China. The Manchu claimed the Mandate of Heaven and thus became the absolute authority. The Manchu were not ethnically Chinese and banned intermarriage between Manchu and the Han (Chinese). The Qing also forced a Manchu Queue hairstyle on all citizens. Despite the Qing’s violent birth, it was far less violent and conquest-centric than its European contrast.

The Qing continued to utilize the civil services exam, which was one of the few remaining relics of the past that this Dynasty actually kept. They acquired Taiwan, parts of Mongolia and Central Asia, and finally Tibet itself as all part of the Ming Dynasty’s reign. 

Emperors Kangxi and Qianlong saw themselves as preservers and restorers of Confucian ideals. They became synonymous with the return of the religion and thus were considered high-level scholars of it by the people. Qianlong was known as a great collector of many of China’s previous and private secret documents and, like the previous Emperor, was heavily learned through these documents and considered an intellectual. 

With the two dynasties out of the way, it is important to note the existence and history of a third nation which was beginning to come to prominence as a hindrance and resister of Ming rule. We are, of course, talking about Japan. 

Japan during this time was ruled under the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Shogunate was a militarized government that focused on its warrior class-leading any and all civilians that didn’t fit that title. With it came Japanese Feudalism and The Code of Bushido (Way of The Warrior). Its capital was the city of Edo, and thus this period was known as the “Edo Period” of Japan. 

The Code of Bushido was a strict system that taught that honor, courage, and loyalty to one's master surpassed any and all other wants or needs in the world. This code made the Japanese Samurai (Japanese version of Knights) heavily revered and respected amongst the populace. 

The Ruler of Japan was The Emperor but below him were several lower lords called “Daimyo.” The Daimyo were those usually in which the Code of Bushido stated a Samurai was to be the most loyal to as the majority of Samurai would find themselves under the employ of a Daimyo. 

Shintoism was the main religion of Japan. Shintoism is a polytheistic religion local to Japan and revolves around supernatural entities known as The Kami. It is a primarily nature-based religion, and most worship is done in Japanese-style shrines that, in today’s modern era, have become quite famous for their amazing designs. 

Of note, the Tokugawa did important things as well for this culture. Of note, Tokugawa Leyasu ended Japanese Feudal Warfare, uniting the country further in its rule. In contrast, Tokugawa Lemitsu brought in Alternative Attendance, which required the Daimyo to divide their time between their own lands and residences and the capital of Edo. 

As time went on, Japan would see itself becoming more and more isolated, and this would come to a head with the National Seclusion Policy of 1635. It allowed for limited interactions and trade with The Dutch, but all other non-Asian countries were to not be dealt with or interacted with at all. That said, the other Asian countries were no better viewed as all of Japan during this time period began to view non-Japanese culture with disgust and scorn. Bringing them further and further into their isolation, and even today, many of these aspects of its culture survive. 

### 5.5 Islamic Gunpowder Empires

When discussing that of the three Islamic Gunpowder Empires, the nations that we are talking about are that of The Ottoman Empire, The Safavid Empire, and the Mughal Empire. All three Empires had unique characteristics, but above all, they were all gunpowder empires. 

The Ottoman Empire centralized its power under that of The Sultan and did so over time. The Sultan would end up with ultimate say and ultimate authority over the whole of the Empire. 

Devshirme, or “Blood Tax,” as some people called it, was the practice of taking Christian Children from their families to be forcibly conscripted into the army. This would constantly bolster both their numbers but also apply pressure on those in the empire that were not Islamic. 

The Haggis Sofi, a traditionally Christian Site, was converted to a mosque as a further slight against its non-Islamic citizens in, which the Ottomans ruled over. Mehmed The Conqueror was a famous leader within The Ottoman Empire who conquered Constantinople and renamed it Istanbul. Another conquest against The Christians. 

One of the reasons for the Ottoman Empire’s dominance and survival was that of the Janissaries. The Janissaries were elite ultra-loyal soldiers that served as the Ottoman Household’s personal troop. It was considered in history to be that of the first “modern” corps in a military unit and was highly lethal and extremely effective. Even so, the Janissaries were slaves in that they like the Devshirme system, were taken through foreigners to bolster its ranks. Believing it better to spill the blood of non-Muslim populations than to use Muslims. In fact, many times, Christians taken from the Devshirme system were converted and brought into that of the Janissaries. 

Selim the I, Sultan of The Ottoman Empire during the period of 1512 – 1520 CE, began the conflict with the Safavid Empire, which would last from 1514 – 1639 with various forms of different conflicts and incidents between the two nations and battles along each other’s borders. 

Suleiman The Magnificent, who reigned from 1520 to 1566 CE, expanded the empire heavily and was known in his empire and amongst his people as “Lawgiver.” The Suleymaniye Mosque was built in his honor in the newly conquered Istanbul in 1557 CE. 

The decline of The Ottoman Empire would begin with defeat at Vienna in 1683 and marked the turning point of Ottoman Domination in Europe. Harem Politics would end up leading to fighting for power and thus weaken the empire in general. From the 1800s and onwards, the Ottoman Empire was known as “The Sick Man of Europe,” as its issues would not cease long after their defeat at Vienna. 

The Safavid Empire was primarily established through military conquest and was a Shi’a Islamic Empire. Like the Ottomans, the Safavid Empire would use that of Slave Labor to bolster their ranks. They used a military unit known as the Ghulams. The Ghulams were absolutely loyal to that of the Shah and his will, whatever it may have been. 

The Safavid Empire were very effective at using both artillery and their rifles in combat. They had a very heavy Persian influence on their people and cultural styles. 

The Decline of The Safavid Empire would come due to several issues that plagued its kingdom. The first of which was a series of ineffectual leaders that would cost the empire dearly in combat. A rebellion would then arise in Afghanistan of Sunni Rebels, and they would fail to put it down, losing the territory and huge amounts of respect in the community. These Afghans would even go on to temporarily take and hold the capital Isfahan for a considerable period of time. 

Eventually, the Ottomans and The Russians both seized land from the Safavid Empire, and the Empire would eventually be replaced by the Zand Dynasty in 1760 CE. 

The final of the three Islamic empires was that of the Mughal Empire. Babur, the Empire's Founder, would conquer the Delhi Sultanate, making it an Islamic Empire with a majority Hindu religious population. 

Akbar, a Mughal Emperor, was extremely tolerant and was widely respected by the people, allowing the Empire to flourish in its early days. Je would eliminate the Jizya as an olive branch to those whom he ruled over. 

A middle period during the Mughal Empire would have been when the ruler of Shah Jahan reigned. He built the Taj Mahal and enjoyed his rule for some time. 

However, the Mughal Empire’s fall would come in the form of Emperor Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb ended the tolerance of the empire up to this point and brought back the Jizya. They began to destroy Hindu temples and began to promote Islam above all else. As a result of this, there would be frequent revolts within the Empire which weakened it, leaving it open to a British Invasion that would come, and by 1757 CE, The Mughal Empire would come to slowly be dominated in all aspects by The British.

### 5.6 Administration

In order to maintain the large lands that many of these conquest-based nations had plans to create, they required strong administration and a heavy reliance on military power. Below will be listed administrative policies that each of the Gunpowder Nations used to try and maintain their power. 

Not only did the Ottoman Empire have that of the Devshirme system, but they also had the iltizām, or “Tax Farming.” Tax Farming kept the empire well funded and essentially meant that taxation was auctioned off to the highest bidder, with the winner being allowed to keep a certain percentage of the tax winnings for their own benefit. 

The Ottomans also had The Millet System. The Millet System, despite the “Blood Tax” from The Christians and all other religious groups, essentially stated that religious communities could govern themselves by their own religious laws so long as their taxes were paid and their dues were on time. This was a major motivation for loyalty from those conscripted into service, as the idea was that eventually, in theory, they could attain their freedom. 

The Mughal empire had their Zamindars and their Rajputs. Rajputs were local Hindu princes who were allowed to retain power in exchange for loyalty. Ramindars of both Hindu and Muslim kinds collected taxes from these Rajputs as well as their own local populations in the area as a means to try and sow trust within the people. The Ramindars would raise large armies in support of the nation and would be very helpful to the progress of the Empire. The Mughals also had the Subah, which was a division of the empire solely focused on tax collecting, focusing specifically on taxable income and how much to collect from agricultural surplus. 

### 5.7 Belief Systems

Within each Empire as well were their own set of belief systems aside from just Islam. In fact, The Ottomans and the Safavid Empire were both primarily Islamic. The issue was the sect of Islam that they were. 

The Ottoman Empire was that of the Sunni Muslims. They believed that Caliphs have to be direct descendants of The Prophet Muhammad. Caliphs were the chief Islamic ruler in the entire world. The Caliph was supposed to be the protector of the entirety of the Islamic world. The Ottomans also believed directly that the Sultan was the Islamic Caliph. The Shi’a, meanwhile, believed that one must be a descendant of Muhammad to take the title of power. This single difference was enough to spark several wars and for the two sides to hate each other greatly, as the Safavids were Shi’a Islamic. 

Whereas the Ottomans ruled over a majority Islamic world, the Safavids Empire did the same; only they were a Shi’a Ruling Minority ruling over a majority Sunni Country. Rebellion and turmoil were inevitable, but this was the system they nonetheless used in the Safavids Empire. 

The Mughal Empire, meanwhile, was a Sunni Islamic minority of ruling elite over a majority Hindu country. Using the methods discussed above seemed like the most logical plan to survive this state of affairs for the whole of the empire. 

In the Safavids Empire, their leader, The Sha, was considered “The Hidden Imam.” Believed to be the last of the Twelve Imams and would bring about peace and justice to the whole of the world. The Empire would encourage uprisings in the Ottoman Empire, constantly using these lines of thinking and using this message.  

### 5.8 Comparison to Land-Based Empires

When comparing those of the Gunpowder Empires to those of the Land-Based Empires, it is important to note what we are referring to. We are referring to the three Islamic Empires versus the rest of the world when making these comparisons. 

Whereas Land Based Empires would and could battle over nearly anything with one another, the primary thing that the Gunpowder Empires ended up fighting over was the sectarian differences between the Sunni and the Shi’a Islamic Faiths. They relied heavily on their weapons and their systems as they made constant war with one another. 

Whereas The Land Based Empires had begun a new adventure: Industrialization. The Gunpowder Empires failed to do this as soon as the other Land Based Empires, and this would result in Europe attaining global dominance over the world stage. Despite this, Russia was able to industrialize as well, making it one of the few in the region to enter the next age with the Europeans. 

## Chapter 6: Transoceanic Interconnections (12-15% of the test)

### 6.1 Technological Innovations 

Due to a growing economic need as well as needed improvements to the existing oceanic trade routes as previously discussed in the Indian Ocean, technology began to diffuse from The East slowly over toward The West. Things like the compass, astronomy, and the sail types used on the routes would improve over time and end up also used for the means of exploration. This means of exploration would fuel a very different era. 

Better ship designs would allow for a far greater distance maximum that could be traveled, which would be required for The East’s exploration of The West. As well as The Indian Ocean’s existing navigation of monsoons being required, this would carry on into general exploration of The West from The East as it continued its journeys over time. This would spur on not just new technology but new techniques and perfected routes that would carry over into all future sailing across the globe.  

### 6.2 Explorations: Causes and Events

Due to new technology and techniques, journey’s once thought impossible now seem possible. Before, most of these types of exploring missions would be seen as “suicidal,” and so very few people would actually go on them or even try and attempt them. With the improvements made, even the more sane and rational individuals would see an opportunity to gleam from a voyage. 

As if that wasn’t enough, nations themselves began to see the opportunity to be had from “The New World” and so began to finance explorers to the various regions in which they felt there could be something of value to be gained. States mostly saw interest in making new connections with new people and thus opening up trade at the time and were truly unaware of the can of worms they were about to open. 

The first to make good progress was The Portuguese, who would focus mostly on mapping and exploring that of Africa. They would succeed, mapping the majority of The West Coast. 

This venture would then inspire Europe to sail across The Atlantic, and so it was. The Spanish would make the game-changing journey and move of financing Christopher Columbus to explore what would come to be known as “The Americas” and begin a large-scale change to the global world. 

The North Atlantic crossings were done by a combination of various explorers sponsored by The British, The French, and The Dutch.

### 6.3 Columbian Exchange

A common mistake made by those studying history is about the term “The Columbian Exchange.” The way we are taught to understand such terms, you would think this was a trade route or some kind of deal made between Columbus and the Native Americans or others with which he had dealt on his journey. In reality, it was not trading. While some limited trading would occur when it was needed by The Pilgrims, this “exchange” was more of a freestyle movement of events and actions that would occur at random over time between the Eastern Hemisphere and The Western Hemisphere. An example of this would be diseases that were spread. Nobody made a deal to obtain a disease as who wants to actually get sick or, worse during these time periods, die? This exchange would have massive demographic shifts for both humans and other species within The Eastern and Western Hemispheres forever. 

Domesticated animals were brought over to the Western Hemisphere. In the case of Spain specifically, they would end up bringing Horses which American Cowboy stereotypes are so famous for in today’s modern age. Had this exchange never occurred, we would never have obtained our famous horses. 

American Food Crops would end up taken from the Americas and taken to Afro-Eurasia, where its rich amount of calories would be very beneficial to the increase in the population of those areas. This exchange would also begin the large-scale beginning of the idea of “Cash Crops.” Cash Crops were the growing of crops for sale rather than for food necessarily. In some cases, some crops couldn’t even be eaten anyway. Examples of this would come in the form of Cotton for example. With an entirely new world to grow, Cash Crops, however, would come to a need for labor, which we will get into shortly a bit later on how this labor was obtained. 

All was not well coming from this exchange, however, as diseases such as Smallpox, Malaria and Measles would all come to The Americas from those in The East. At the same time, The West would get its “vengeance” in the form of venereal syphilis sent to The East. 

### 6.4 Maritime Empires Established

Maritime Empires were the opposite of Land Based Empires. Whereas Land Based Empires focused on land, Maritime Empires focused primarily on trade and territorial dominance, and holdings abroad. Maritime Empires would have constant trade posts littered all over the world, and so Maritime Empires, by sheer existence, could never be isolationist and instead were entirely about trading and interacting with other Land Based or other Maritime Based states and nations. 

Europeans had almost solely all contact with trading in The Americas using these trading posts or their own that were made. They would, as such, come to dominate and fully control the “Columbian Exchange” that was set up between The East and West.

Expansions to the empires, especially in Europe, would lead to new economic and social systems and opportunities. The land taken via colonies as well would come in handy as means of conquest and the means to grow these economies.

With the new focus on Cash Crop based economies, The Colonies, which had begun settling in the Americas, saw a new labor system and economy being used. Plantation Systems. Plantation Systems were large-scale plots of farmland that required massive amounts of labor to maintain the sheer amount of crops on the plantation itself. It was highly efficient and extremely economically beneficial to those selling; however, the high labor requirements for these systems would come at a huge drawback.

The Cash Crop plantation labor requirements were immense, and it seemed that the Europeans couldn’t find enough workers to meet this demand. As such, Europeans turned to an old method of labor: Slavery. Only over time would they advance this practice further with the invention of Chattel Slavery. 

Chattel Slavery was the shipment and storage of human beings, slaves, in large amounts packed together in ships. The idea was to maximize profits by buying slaves in bulk rather than individually. Some ships could hold hundreds of slaves by packing slaves on top of one another in tiny rooms under the decks of the ship. This would grow the security market for these slave ships, further increasing the economy at great cost to the locations where they were taking their slaves from. 

Meanwhile, this dominance would come at the great expense of other nations around the world and cause great changes everywhere. First, in Africa, Europe would spell either the rise and growth of some nations or the fall and decline of others. The trend tended to be those nations that embraced European trade and interactions would grow and prosper and would see their power increase due to European weapons as well, which were provided. Whereas those that defied or resisted Europe tended to begin a rapid decline and tended to end up defeated by those nations supported by Europe due to the power differences. Worst yet, those states that would end up in decline would be used for the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in the form of slave raids conducted by Europeans for use in labor. More on that later. 

The Indian Ocean trade route continued to exist during this time period and, in fact, was integrated into both the Columbian Exchange but also found its uses for the Slave Trade in some instances.

For a myriad of reasons, be it the large-scale use of slaves or the nature of maritime empires coming to dominate those they traded with, The Ming Dynasty of China during its time period would go on to limit European trading. Tokugawa Japan, as previously discussed, would take that far further and only allow very select and limited trade with their Dutch partners. They also limited interactions with these port locations heavily. 

### 6.5 Maritime Empires Maintained and Developed

As Maritime Empires developed, a new ideology for economics came into most nations using this method. That ideology was that of mercantilism, a high value in trading but also the belief that a maritime empire needed to export more than it imported. This would generate large amounts of revenue but also would allow no nation that practiced this belief system to fall into domination by any other. 

Joint Stock Companies would come into existence based on the soaring economic status of these various companies that worked for Maritime Empires, such as the infamous East India Trading Company. Monopolies were becoming a major factor that little could be done about; however, due to the sheer manpower, will, and distance between The New World and The Old. If a company began to dominate a product, it would flex that dominance in its prices and drastically skyrocket its profit margins. 

The global influx of silver increased due to mining opportunities in the Americas which, as much of economics was done using metal coins at the time, would greatly expand the potential stake each and every member of society could maintain within said society.  

Competition between nations would begin to rise, and not just that of the Maritime Empires facing off against one another. It would lead to heavy rivalries and even, in some instances, conflict. One such rivalry was that between the Ottomans and The Portuguese. The Portuguese would set up various sea outposts as well as trading ports within Ottoman territory which the Ottomans didn’t necessarily agree to or like. This put a Gunpowder Empire at odds with a maritime one. Then, Moroccan and Songhai nations would end up in actual conflict over these rivalries, and by nature of the competition, the two nations opposed to one another. Finally, in the Indian Ocean, Muslim-European relations were strained and greatly at odds with one another in terms of economic interests. 

Due to the sheer volume of goods coming in from “The New World,” Artisan and peasant labor became further divided as one man would be so busy with the sheer volume of required goods that they would never have time to switch. This further divided the classes further along and would come to symbolize the new status quo from herein. 

Family and gender restructuring would occur en mass on the entire continent of Africa due to the ramifications of the European Slave Trade causing massive demographic shifts. Due to the nature of slave labor being that of hard labor, men were valued far more than women for the use of slavery, as such. Most slave raids and slave purchases would be conducted on and for the acquisition of African Men. This would leave behind many women who were spared a hard life of labor in many instances and required all societies contributing to these slave trades to completely rethink who should remain in charge as well as who would maintain the nations while all the men would disappear. 

Cultural synthesis would come in the forms of all the movement of people, spreading culture and religious beliefs like wildfire, amongst others. This would also spread conflict as well due to these beliefs; however, these would also be increased by the rapid rate at which they could now be communicated.  

### 6.6 Internal and External Challenges to State Power

All was not smooth sailing, however, internally or even externally, as it would come as no surprise that resistance movements and revolts would grow in response to these rapid changes that some even viewed as immoral. While on the home front internally, most Maritime Empires were quite stable, the majority of resistance movements and rebellions would occur in colonies, trading posts, or from local populations that had been “colonized.” The logic for this was simple; we weren’t yet in the modern era in which, within hours, forces could swoop in and counterattack resistance forces; it would take months on a voyage. As such, resistance movements had plenty of time to lay siege, capture, and set up defenses to render their “oppressors” jobs harder. 

Notable rebellions included the Cossack Rebellion of Russia against states claiming dominion over the Cossack Territory. The Pueblo Revolts from the Native Americans in the Americas occurred in what largely would by modern standards be called “New Mexico” against The Spanish and African Queen Ana Nzinga’s resistance, which lasted thirty years in the countries of Ndongo and Matamba which lasted 30 years against The Portuguese. 

Not only did the above notable incidents occur, but so too did a growing movement of Slave Resistance ideology that fought for their own form of freedom away from The Colonizers. These occurred mostly in North America as well as Brazil. While some resistances rose and fell, the most prominent and effective forms of resistance were a type of society, in fact, called a “Maroon Society.” 

Maroon Societies were groups of runaway slaves that would band together to create their own forms of resistance civilizations against any and all who would attempt to take them back. They tended to be armed and experienced in escape and combat due to the nature of being slave escapees. These societies would put up such a fight that oftentimes, most military powers would surrender. Of note, Jamaica was forced to have a treaty made with them in order to cope with the fact that they simply could not take back their runaway slaves. A major defeat for The British in that instance, but they were not the only ones. Maroon Societies tended to exist in Africa but could be found in The Americas as well, scattered amongst the land. 

The North American Slave revolts saw small victories, and often times many of these freedmen would escape to that of the Maroon Societies. As such, The Colonizers had the best interest to ensure that they didn’t make it to these pockets of land; else, they become uncapturable and more powerful than they could ever imagine. The largest North American Slave Revolt was that of The Stono Rebellion, which saw 20 slaves escape at once successfully.

### 6.7 Changing Social Hierarchies 

Growing diversity in empires would cause suppression efforts. As racial purity was still considered of high importance (racism), countries would adopt various methods on how to deal with those that would come into their ranks. For example, Jews and Moriscos were expelled from Spain. Another example of this would be the previously mentioned Qing Dynasty’s policies against the Han Chinese. 

Diversity would also lead to new social classes. For example, in the Americas, a caste system began between that of the Colonizer, colonists, Native Americans, and The Slave. 

Existing elites would see their power shifted away from them in some instances and into new forms of elite forces. For example, The Russian Boyars, who were rich land owners in Russia, lost much power. European Nobility had the same issue, as with all the constant new avenues to acquire power, people would try and take that power by any means necessary that they felt fit, even if it meant from each other. 

### 6.8 Continuity and Change

While much has changed in terms of the way the world now runs during this time period, much has still stayed the same. For example, transoceanic travel existed prior via the Indian Ocean trade route and just general sailing; however, improvements to the technology had greatly set the speed and quantity of passengers ahead. The era would drastically show the major benefits and as well as just how big of an impact technology advancing would have on the whole of the world. 

Cultures that had never interacted before had started to do so and even be dominated by others, such as The Americas and The Eastern Hemisphere. 

Labor systems continued to use slave labor within them just as they had many years prior. Only now, however, they bought in bulk and by far higher means than previously done. The process would become far more involved, and the sheer size of the entire operation was far larger than ever seen, so much so it was fair to carve out an entire section of the European economy and call it the “Slave Economy.” The number of slaves would only continue to increase as well due to The Columbian Exchange.  

While many empires had fallen and risen, Europe had gone from a disunified mess to a powerhouse of the seas. Wielding power and influence over not just some nations but essentially the entire world. Meaning the difference between your nation's decline and your nation's rise just on the basis of if they treated you right or not was a very prideful thing you can imagine. While other nations would continue to rise and fall, Europe was a consistent slow turtle that essentially would constantly be in a very slow state of rising. Once it had plateaued, it would not fall again, even in today’s modern era. 

# Part 4: c. 1750 to c. 1900

## Chapter 7: Revolutions (12-15% of the test)

### 7.1 Age of Enlightenment

The Age of Enlightenment was a period in time in which everything of how society had been running up to this point was now being questioned. It was the beginning of where many of our modern ideas began to take shape and form into a coherent line of thought. Collectively the world began to question things such as slavery, women’s rights, The Devine Right, and Monarchies in general. All of it began to enter the scope of questioning. Interestingly enough, however, it turns out that the majority of all Enlightenment key texts were printed previously and weren’t actually written in this new Age that was beginning to take shape. While there were many philosophers and scholars of note during this Age of Enlightenment, in this text will be mentioned the key ones of most importance and relevance to our modern history as well as to key events that would occur in response to this age. 

John Locke spoke about the natural rights of human beings. Natural rights were different than written rights. Natural rights were things that would exist in nature without any form of influence. Others call them inalienable rights, such as within our own United States Constitution. More on that later, though. Along the same vein, however, and of important note was John Locke’s speaking of a people to overthrow a corrupt or tyrannical government should the need and requirement arise within a society. 

Rousseau would take John Locke’s philosophy of Natural Rights and make the argument that for the good of society, some of those natural rights should be curbed. This would benefit and safeguard a community. This idea was that of the Social Contract. An invisible contract that every citizen who willingly allows themselves to be ruled by a government makes with said government. Examples of this social contract in action would be speed limits on roads. Speed is limited, and thus, your rights are curtailed in the name of keeping everyone safe and healthy. For example, if you are too speedy, you are more likely to get into accidents, and if everyone did that (speeding), then accidents would be frequent. Essentially without Rousseau, there could never be a legitimate government in existence. 

Montesquieu would write about the separation of powers, and they primarily would boil down to what we in the United States would use today. Those powers were that of The Executive, a figurehead leader of the military who had emergency powers to act swiftly when a vast Republic would be too slow to do so. The Legislative served as what we would call: Congress. The Lawmaking body where all ideas would come forth. Finally, there would be the Judicial Branch which would interpret the laws and ensure they were constitutional and within the spirit of the citizen's best interests. It would also serve as the chief justice branch of all courts. 

Voltaire, meanwhile, would write about the freedom of speech as an all-time important right to be maintained. He also wrote about the importance of religious toleration and respect for those who believed as they did. 

All of these philosophers were key instruments in the coming revolutions that would soon take shape across this era around the entirety of the world. 

### 7.2 Nationalism and Revolutions in the Period

The Age of Enlightenment was the catalyst for a growing sense of discontent with the status quo, and this would manifest itself in several “revolutions” that would take place and would forever change the entire world forever. 

In an age of Imperialism combined with that of Nationalist expansion interests for the Maritime Empires of Europe, a resistance was beginning to stir within The Americas. A question began to arise about the social contract set up between that of a nation an ocean away and that of their own colonies set up in the Americas. Eventually, however, this would come to a head. 

The British had gone to war with both The French, who were supporting Indian Insurgents who meant to oppose The British rule of their colonies and expanding territories. In response to this, however, The British were left with massive wartime debts that needed to be settled, and they had little means of doing under the current systems. So, the final nail in the coffin was struck. The British raised taxes on the colonists as a means to try and recover some of the wartime damages that they had been dealt. They did this in the form of the Stamp Act and the Revenue Act. The Colonists came to see this as taxation without representation, and so the match was lit. 

The idea behind Taxation Without Representation was thus: The Colonists were paying not just taxes but increased taxes without any form of rights within the government that was running the show and dictating how to run their lives. The psychological and literal factor of this nation being an ocean away in a time when it could take months for ships to arrive left The Colonists with a strong sense that they could get away from this system, and so it had begun. 

The first act of rebellion and the true way that this all started was an event known as The Boston Tea Party. The Boston Tea Party was a day in which The Colonists came together and dumped all the British Tea into the ocean as an act of defiance to the government. In response, the British Would begin a series of actions to try and scare The Colonists, but in the end, they would not be perturbed, and they would publish directly to the King of England, The Declaration of Independence. A formal document declaring their independence from England. England would respond by beginning what is known as in American History as The Revolutionary War, but to the world, this would be known as The American Revolution. 

In the chaos that would ensue involving this war, The French would find themselves allying once again with The Colonists in order to spite Britain. A form of vengeance for their failures in the Indian War. 

In the end, The Revolutionary War would end in the now formalized United States of America breaking away from the mother country of Britain. The Articles of Confederation failed, and so they instead formalized and created The Constitution of The United States and passed The Bill of Rights, which serves as the first ten amends. Among them of note were The Freedom of Speech and Religion and the right to bear arms to defend themselves from the form of a tyrannical government that could come even from themselves. Formally enshrining many of the Enlightenment ideas into law. They also would create the three branches of government discussed prior in their exactness into their actual means of running the country itself. 

The American Revolution, however, would not be the only revolution. In fact, it would serve as a catalyst and inspiration for many other revolutions across the world that would begin against The Maritime Powers of Europe. 

After The American Revolution would come that of The French Revolution, and in part, it was heavily inspired, in fact, by the spirit of The American Revolution.  

France was in hard times. They were experiencing severe financial difficulties due to the loss of The 7 Years' War, The Indian Wars (Native American Forces in The Americas), and their support of the forming of The United States of America. France, in fact, had sent for aid from that newer United States, but The United States saw only chaos and issues that would come out of it, which in history they would prove to be correct in that fear and assumption. 

The Financial Crisis of their war debts would end up creating extreme food shortages in the country. These Food Shortages would result in revolts and riots demanding for this issue to be solved, and so a meeting of The Estates General was called.

Before continuing, The French Estates were a set of classes for the people of France, and everyone fell into one of them. In total, there were Three Estates. The First Estate was that of the clergy. The Second Estate was that of the nobility, and The Third Estate was that of the commoners. The Estates each had a representative in their system of government that was supposed to advocate for them on their behalf. 

However, when The Estates General meeting was called, the solution they came up with was to raise taxes on The Third Estate. Having been already suffering from food shortages and hard economic times, this only exasperated the problem and The Third Estate went into full revolt. 

The Third Estate would meet on The Tennis Court, and so The Tennis Court Oath was now taken. A National Assembly was formed, and The French Revolution was in full swing. Their goal was the establishment of what they viewed to be that of a modest proposal. Whereas The Americans would end up going for a full republic, The French People would demand that of a constitutional monarchy. A hybrid system that would keep the nobility intact but at great power lost to them. 

There was much chaos, and many people of nobility and of any state power, in many cases, would find themselves beheaded by the angry mob of The French people. Resulting in the deaths of many and the complete and total restructuring of their governments. Many buildings were also stormed and taken out/over. They would eventually achieve their constitutional monarchy, but at this point, it would not be enough, and a new thirst for bloodshed would reign. They now wanted a full-on Republic, just as The United States had achieved. They called this period of time: “The Reign of Terror” due to just how much fear was in the streets. 

In history, this revolution is seen as a toss-up or “gray” on whether or not it was a success or not. The sheer bloodshed was cataclysmic. They had ended The Absolute Monarchy under which they lived and obtained the constitutional monarchy but would keep going beyond their original message. Civil unrest was so high that while they would eventually, for mere moments, achieve their republic, in the end then, a new dictator in the form of Napoleon would rush the government in its early days and take over everything, bringing everything back to that of an Absolute Monarchy. 

For many years there was civil unrest as the country was run by a military dictatorship by Napoleon. Napoleon; a General who wanted to conquer the world in the same vein as other famous dictators. Eventually, Napoleon would be ousted, and France would then come to return to a constitutional monarchy system. In that sense, the originalists of the revolution had obtained their victory in the end. However, there were so many voices, so much chaos, and so many complicated events that occurred in this revolution; it’s fair to say that those that committed to the actual acts of the revolution itself didn’t all win. It was a compromised victory in the end for the originalists though even they couldn’t be called a clear winner. No one could. 

The Haitian Revolution was inspired by The Enlightenment ideas that no man should be enslaved. Much in the spirit of The United States, All Men Are Created Equal line of logic. This revolution would occur at the same time as The French Revolution, meaning that two revolutions simultaneously would occur at the same time. It would see the success of the previous American Revolution and so would pave a blueprint for how to fight what The Haitians would view as their Colonist Oppressors. 

The Haitian Revolution started as a slave revolt and so would find itself where most slave revolts would occur; at the plantations. Enslaved populations were extremely high, at a staggering 450,000 estimated at least. However, White (Colonist) populations only numbered 4000. Meaning that the slaves had a massive numbers advantage. Call it a superiority complex due to technology; whatever reason, you try to justify it as it was a massive mistake to leave such a massive disproportion. 

Among The Haitian people was also a group of mixed-race people known as Mulattoes. Mulattoes were mixed race, born to one white and one black parent. The Mulattoes would number 20 thousand. They tended to be very wealthy and well-off. Even so, there tended to be tensions between this group and The Colonists. 

Tactically, The Haitian Revolution was heavily inspired by The American Revolution in that they fought many battles in the same style. Ambushes. Guerrilla warfare in their combat against The French. This would prove as effective as it was on The British. 

Toussaint Louverture started off as enslaved but eventually became a part of the freed black population. He would lead the revolt and the entirety of the revolution as its most effective leader. For American Comparisons, he would be like that of our George Washington. 

Eventually, in the midst of the revolution, despite good gains and some talks about potential peace or agreements that could be made, great fear rose in The Haitian population as Napoleon had brought about tyranny. As such, due to fears of what Napoleon would do as France would cave to his leadership, Haiti went further; in fact, they went all the way. It would fully force France out and, in 1804, declared itself independent. The Independent State of Haiti. 

Haiti would go on to create a Republic system in the same vein as The United States to the best of its ability. However, that ability would become hindered as The French would require indemnity payments as part of eventual treaty agreements that would end up crippling Haiti’s developments, and effects of this can still be seen even in today's modern history. 

Another revolution was that of the Latin Revolution. Whereas in Haiti, former slaves had paved the way forward toward their new nation, in this revolution, The Creoles would lead the charge here.

Creoles in Latin America served the same purpose and function as that of the Mulattoes in Haiti. They were mixed race. The only difference was that they were in Latin America and that this time it would be them that led the way toward revolution. 

Simon Bolivar was the leader of these revolutions and envisioned a confederation of Latin American states in opposition to The Spanish Empire. While he failed to realize this dream of a confederation of states in the same vein as The United States, Simon Bolivar and his calls for revolution successfully gained independence for several now nation-states. These nations' states were: Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. 

The final revolution to occur was more one globally and wasn’t an actual form of “war” or gunfight. The Women’s Empowerment Revolution, or The Feminist Revolution. During this time period, women were not just considered inferior to men, but the way the laws were written in basically every country, they were even inferior on paper. Women wouldn’t have certain rights men would, such as the example of the right to vote and suffrage. As such, a feminist movement would slowly begin to grow over centuries demanding equal rights as well as the right specifically to vote in places such as America or any other Republic-style system. 

The Seneca Falls convention of 1848 was a large-scale feminist convention in which they discussed various feminist topics. The audience, however, was actually heavily mixed as many male allies would show up to the event. So many, in fact, you could argue that the event had both sexes as a considerable amount. 

Despite these movements across the world and a common theme shared amongst its members, it would take until our more modern history for women to actually get the right to vote, and some would even argue today that women are not equal to men as of yet due to a number of societal factors. 

### 7.3 Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution, out of all of the previously listed revolutions, was undoubtedly globally the most important revolution to ever occur. Gone now were the days of making things with your hands, and coming now was the days of creating with the machine instead. This is considered a revolution as it changed everything about how humans would collectively organize, create, and even about what they would be fighting about. 

The number of producible resources exploded in sheer quantity and quality from the use of machines. This would create new jobs as well as start booming economies with factories. 

However, work conditions in those factories tended to be bad, and so oftentimes, they would go to places like pubs or other locations to “destress.” Women and children would work in these factories, and many of all groups would become injured, get sick or even die. This would increase the number of hospitals and medical areas within nearby areas. 

At first, factories would tend to be close to waterways and especially rivers, as the water was required to operate much of the machinery. As such, towns and developing urban centers around these factories always needed to follow very specific sets of town blueprints to maximize the efficiency they could achieve due to the position of these waterways. 

Enter 1785 with the invention of The Steam Engine by Thomas Savery, however, for the price of coal. This would allow factories to now be built anywhere and would change the layouts of developing locations even further, and allow build diversity to best deal with the terrain in which structures were built. All at the cost of fossil fuel emissions, however, that would begin to damage our planet. This would eventually lead away from the village/country lifestyle and even away from towns and instead began to favor a new type of urban center known as Cities. Modern cities as we know them now today. 

### 7.4 Industrialization Spreads in the Period

Industrialization would spread throughout the globe but in different ways. The following is a list of keynotes on how industrialization would spread throughout the world and using some countries are examples.

In The United States, while some regulations would be forced on companies through the collective action of Labor Unions eventually also advocating for laws, for the most part, The United States would take a very Laissez Faire approach to companies and regulation. They would also have the same attitude in many ways for tax breaks for these companies as well to stimulate and encourage the economy. Even Henry Ford and Rockefeller, despite their monopolies, would take a long time to actually be regulated and proved to what extent companies could actually push things before Uncle Sam would even do anything about them. Public land would even be given away to railroad companies in order to develop railroad tracks and thus allow for even further expansion. 

While this would happen for the companies, slum neighborhoods would begin to develop and become a wider scale. New immigrants to the country as well would be taken advantage of and usually hired for extremely lower wages. In exactness, this has even continued in today’s modern America as well, so it’s safe to say this is the period in which modern America was beginning to take shape. 

Economy-wise, America was extremely diverse. Focusing on almost everything. Textiles, the new cars, steel. They would work on and develop anything and everything and did it fairly well. 

In Russia, meanwhile, they would focus mostly on state-sponsored labor as a means to stimulate and encourage the economy. The primary means by which they would do this was the large-scale construction efforts of The Trans-Siberian Railroad. Eventually, thanks to these efforts, it would be completed. Russia’s economy was that of a “heavy industry,” meaning they would mostly focus on heavy object creations. Iron, shipbuilding, and steel would be a primary example of this. 

Japan, meanwhile, at first remained heavily isolationist and resisted industrialization. However, with the sudden appearance of Mathew Perry and his “black smoke” ships to their shores from The United States of America, as well as his boasting taunts toward them, The Japanese would secretly be both impressed and also humbled. He would threaten extreme violence against them, and so they conceded they would lose, and so Japan was opened up by force. This action would result at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate and begin The Meji Restoration, which was essentially the re-empowering of The Japanese Emperor. 

With The Japanese Emperor back in place, Japan would begin to initialize state-sponsored and supported forms of industrialization. In Asia, as such, they would be one of the first to actually embrace industrialization in the time period. More than that, they would be heavily industrialized as well, putting them a league above their neighbors. 

### 7.5 The Technology of the Industrial Age

Technology would come in two different waves. Those waves were that of the First Industrial Revolution and then those of The Second. The keynote to tell which technology would likely fit into which is to separate the two waves like this: The First Wave was The Age of Mechanization and focused mostly on early machine creation and automation. Whereas the Second Wave could be considered The Age of Science, bringing with it chemicals, electricity, and steel.  

The Flying Shuttle and the Spinning Jenny would be created to further enhance automated practices and the creation of fabrics. The Cotton Gin would assist with this as well. The biggest innovation, however, for production would come in the concept of The Assembly Line. 

The Assembly Line was a technique and set of tools that would speed up the production of essentially every creation that needed to be made. A line was made, usually on a conveyor belt, and on that line, every person would have a set of tools and a job. That person would do that job, and then the item would continue down the line. In our modern age, this would change and advance to machines in some cases, but during this time period, it was mostly done by actual real people. 

The creation of the locomotive, however, would change the means of travel just as much as just better sails and ship designs would allow for the settling of the modern world. Railroads and train tracks would come under construction for use for the average citizen to commute for work and even just travel the world. Laying the groundwork for greater amounts of travel at far greater speed. Making travel once thought impossible or simply too “inconvenient” now seemed less so, just as the ships in the past had done.  

In the same vein as the locomotive but more personalized and individualized, we now come to that of The Model T Ford. The Model T was the first truly working and affordable car that the average citizen could get their hands on and would allow them to drive in much the same way our modern-day cars do. This would replace the horse usage up to this point that had been dominating the means of most road-based travel and would change the landscape of the entire world. No longer would small horse-sized gravel paths work. Now roadways would come under construction and eventually even highways for the interest and use of fast travel at your own pace at your own time. Once again, however, at the cost of fossil fuel emissions, but again few actually paid attention to that back then. This would further urbanize the entire world, not just one particular country.

With faster means of travel would also come faster forms of communication in the form of the telegraph. The telegraph would allow the sending of documents over large distances for the use of business and, eventually, for the same purpose mail could even serve. 

It didn’t stop there! Next would come the invention of the telephone, which would allow the long-distance communication of nearly anyone you wanted, so now, besides just the use of documents, you could phone anyone you wanted. This would again change society in that now people could be of longer distances away and still keep in contact. Allowing families to further divide out for the sake of work or whatever other means they needed or wanted. Eventually, this would even go international, allowing people in entirely different countries to communicate with the simple dial of a telephone number. 

Then since the dawn of man with fire, humans had been trying to escape the dark. With the invention of the lightbulb now, which emitted more light than candles at the cost of electricity, houses would now be much brighter lit at night. Moreover, lights would come in the form of street lamps used to light up roads for traveling cars at night. 

### 7.6 Industrialization: Government’s Role

The emergence of The Middle Class had begun in this time period. The Middle Class were people who had the money for leisure but were by no means the majority at all. In fact, the majority of people were living paycheck to paycheck and would rinse and repeat a cycle of waking up, going to work, work, go home to sleep, repeat for all of their lives. To some, it was maddening, but it would provide food for the table and the whole family at that. However, wages were extremely low nonetheless. 

Many could barely afford to pay their bills, while factory owners only continued to rake in more and more of the profits. Becoming all powerful and rich. This was not only the case for factory owners, however. Across all industries would come powerful men who would create a product and then monopolize it. Men such as the infamous Rockefeller and his oil tycoon. 

Worse yet, in the example of factory workers, the entire family had been uprooted. With women and children working in factories, sometimes not even the same one as it was entirely up to the factory to hire you or not, families would struggle severely, barely seeing one another and constantly being on the move. 

Housing would also come to become a crisis as barely could housing and the very nature of space itself keep up with the sheer volume of people moving into urban centers and cities specifically. Leading to issues of how people would even get to work in the first place. This is why the invention of things such as The Model T and the locomotive were so critical to keep this system going. 

Worse yet still, while few paid attention to it, as previously mentioned, pollution was indeed starting to have an effect on the environment as well as began to worsen and worsen over time as more and more factories and uses of fossil fuels began to occur. 

As a result, in the end, governments had two roles to play and would indeed play them to the best of their ability. Each government would decide those two roles out of a total of three options. The first option that every government was required to choose was that of the regulator. The question was to what amount and how often. In the United States, as discussed previously, that regulatory role would be limited as they took a more Laissez Faire approach. Even so, some regulations would come into existence to appease workers suffering from the conditions described above. 

The second role the government would need to choose was that of incentive or command. Only one of the two could be chosen. Those who picked incentives, such as the United States, would offer tax breaks or certain labor laws that would still incentivize companies to work in the country at the cost of something else. Or in the case of Russia during this time period as well, entire parts of labor could or would be state-sponsored. In other words, the state would see a need and thus would pay for that labor to be done. The examples mostly of “command” would come later in Russia as well, however, under the Soviet Union’s communist system. 

With its two roles chosen, the government was set, and even today, governments act in much the same exact way when it comes to economics. They have two roles to take in, and they must stick to them once they are taken. 

### 7.7 Economic Developments and Innovations in the Industrial Age

While economics would boom under these new systems, especially in places like Europe and The United States, it came with many caveats that will be discussed below.

As a result of all the issues listed above, resentment and anger would begin to grow in the “working class,” as it would be coined. Intellectual thinkers would begin to look at and see these types of systems occurring and begin to debate and theorize. 

So it would come that Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels would enter the debate using their newly published “Communist Manifesto.” It would challenge Adam Smith’s view of the world, which was that free market capitalism would lead to better opportunities for everyone. Karl would counter this by bringing up the horrible wages and what he viewed as the exploitation of those within the factories. Challenging the entire system as simply one of exploitation with opportunities for the few on the backs of the workers (the many). 

What is important to note about this time period is Marx knew nothing of The Soviet Union or that it would even exist and use his ideas. Those regions would, of course, later use his ideas, and he would gain popular followers of this belief in the pre soviet union.  For example, in Russia, Vladimir Lenin studied and learned Marx's ideology greatly. This would lead to Communist Revolutions. Their solution to what they viewed as a major issue. 

In The United States, however, the solutions would come from the collective bargaining of Labor Unions, which would advocate at all times for their people. These would result in new safety protocols, the end of child labor, and minimum wage laws. At first, it would start, however, before the government as just forcing these companies via their power to cave into them. The laws would come later and were almost redundant by the time they actually came into place. 

Meanwhile, in The Middle East, they would face a very steep and damaging decline. They were extremely slow to industrialize, and so they would be surpassed. Most of their economy and use of technology would be in the use of their old ship designs, but as more methods of transportation had come into existence, the need for such things was going down. Demand was dying. Worse yet, textiles made in the Middle East were not only viewed as inferior, but due to less experienced workers due to it coming down to that slow start, it tended to actually be indeed inferior. So that business would tend to go to Europe or to The United States instead.

European imperialism would rear its ugly head once more as nations that it would tend to brutally and decisively defeat would be forced to sign unfair treaties. Worse yet, in some cases, those treaties would be ignored, and they simply would steal resources from conquered nations despite treaties saying otherwise. 

This would lead to many “dependent nations.” These were nations that rallied on the imports of other nations to even develop in any meaningful way. This is where the concept of “The Third World” would begin to slowly take shape.
