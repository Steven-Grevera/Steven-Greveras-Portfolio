# Part One: General Information

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 About the Exam

The AP World History: Modern exam is designed by multiple committees of college expert AP level teachers and tests how well you have absorbed information as a high school student doing a first-year college-level course. The course is sanctioned by the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program. The exams will determine whether or not you have a college-level historical examination ability and will, as such, advance you through your journey in college earlier. 

### 1.2 Structure of the Exam

In total, the entire exam lasts 3 hours and 55 minutes and is broken up into four different parts lasting different lengths of time. Of those parts, there are two sections. Section one is parts 1 and 2, and Section Two is parts Three and Four. Traditionally, between Sections I and Sections II is a small break of 10 minutes for a snack and some downtime before moving on to the next section. No student may move ahead of the testing group and must wait patiently should they finish ahead. 

- The first portion of the exam is a series of 55 questions in which you are given 55 minutes for the entire section. Meaning that the best course of action would be one minute maximum on each question to have enough time to successfully get through them all. These questions can consist of any of the following:

  * Questions usually appear in sets of 3–4 questions.
    
  * Students analyze historical texts, interpretations, and evidence.
    
  * Primary and secondary sources, images, graphs, and maps are included.

- The second part of section one is the short answer portion. In this portion, you will be asked to write your answer down in your testing booklet. You will be tasked with analyzing historical sources, interpretations, or propositions. Sometimes questions will include images or maps. Questions 1 and 2 are required and consistent for each and every student, whereas for your third and final question, you will be asked to pick between two different questions and only one. Questions 1 and 2 will contain historical sources for you, whereas the final two will have no sources at all. You will have 40 minutes for this part, so ideally, you will want to spend around 13 minutes on each question to leave any extra time over for the next question. In case some are easier for you than others.

- The first part of Section Two begins with 7 DBQs, in which you have an hour to respond to each. Ideally, as such, you will want to spend 8 minutes on each document which will leave 4 minutes for you to spend on any documents that might give you trouble.

- The second and last part of Section II and the final part of the entire test is the long essay. This essay you will write is usually in the form of a prompt and you are given a choice between 3 different prompt choices. You are given an allotted time limit of 40 minutes. The prompts given are never known beforehand, and as such, you should be ready for anything for this section. This is where your studying will really pay off the most.

### 1.3 Scoring
Your final overall score is based on a scale of one – five. One being the worst and five being the best. The multiple choice questions are scanned into a machine and graded accordingly based on your bubble fills ins. The written questions are checked by different AP teachers and collegiate staff. The scoring percentages for each part are as follows: 
- Part I counts for 40% of your total score (55 multiple choice questions).
- Part Two counts for 20% of your score (3 short form answers.)
- Part Three counts for 25% of your score (7 DBQs.)
- Part Four counts for 15% of your score (Long Form Essay).

### 1.4 Test-taking Tips and Strategies
- Use study guides and practice tests. 
  * In our case, luckily, we have both provided in this booklet for you. Study guides are a key way to gain information but also to practice potential test questions for the test. This should be your primary form of studying as it is far faster to study using guides than the entire textbooks themselves. 


- Read this more than once. 
  * When it comes to studying, don’t read everything one time and call it there. Read it all multiple times. So, for example, if you don’t remember a section by heart, read it once, then go back to it. Each time you do so, you should retain more and more until the point that when your studying, you find yourself skipping as you just know it all by heart. Aim for this for all sections. 

- Study Breaks
  * The brain needs time to rest. You cannot study nonstop without a break and hope to retain all of the information. However, taking too many or too long of breaks can also make you run out of time. The best course of action is to find that perfect happy middle between breaks and studying, and for each and every student, that is something that must be found out on your own.
