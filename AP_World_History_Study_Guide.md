# Part One: General Information

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 About the Exam

The AP World History: Modern exam is designed by multiple committees of college expert AP level teachers and tests how well you have absorbed information as a high school student doing a first-year college-level course. The course is sanctioned by the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program. The exams will determine whether or not you have a college-level historical examination ability and will, as such, advance you through your journey in college earlier. 

### 1.2 Structure of the Exam

In total, the entire exam lasts 3 hours and 55 minutes and is broken up into four different parts lasting different lengths of time. Of those parts, there are two sections. Section one is parts 1 and 2, and Section Two is parts Three and Four. Traditionally, between Sections I and Sections II is a small break of 10 minutes for a snack and some downtime before moving on to the next section. No student may move ahead of the testing group and must wait patiently should they finish ahead. 

- The first portion of the exam is a series of 55 questions in which you are given 55 minutes for the entire section. Meaning that the best course of action would be one minute maximum on each question to have enough time to successfully get through them all. These questions can consist of any of the following:

  * Questions usually appear in sets of 3–4 questions.
    
  * Students analyze historical texts, interpretations, and evidence.
    
  * Primary and secondary sources, images, graphs, and maps are included.

- The second part of section one is the short answer portion. In this portion, you will be asked to write your answer down in your testing booklet. You will be tasked with analyzing historical sources, interpretations, or propositions. Sometimes questions will include images or maps. Questions 1 and 2 are required and consistent for each and every student, whereas for your third and final question, you will be asked to pick between two different questions and only one. Questions 1 and 2 will contain historical sources for you, whereas the final two will have no sources at all. You will have 40 minutes for this part, so ideally, you will want to spend around 13 minutes on each question to leave any extra time over for the next question. In case some are easier for you than others.

- The first part of Section Two begins with 7 DBQs, in which you have an hour to respond to each. Ideally, as such, you will want to spend 8 minutes on each document which will leave 4 minutes for you to spend on any documents that might give you trouble.

- The second and last part of Section II and the final part of the entire test is the long essay. This essay you will write is usually in the form of a prompt and you are given a choice between 3 different prompt choices. You are given an allotted time limit of 40 minutes. The prompts given are never known beforehand, and as such, you should be ready for anything for this section. This is where your studying will really pay off the most.

### 1.3 Scoring
Your final overall score is based on a scale of one – five. One being the worst and five being the best. The multiple choice questions are scanned into a machine and graded accordingly based on your bubble fills ins. The written questions are checked by different AP teachers and collegiate staff. The scoring percentages for each part are as follows: 
- Part I counts for 40% of your total score (55 multiple choice questions).
- Part Two counts for 20% of your score (3 short form answers.)
- Part Three counts for 25% of your score (7 DBQs.)
- Part Four counts for 15% of your score (Long Form Essay).

### 1.4 Test-taking Tips and Strategies
- Use study guides and practice tests. 
  * In our case, luckily, we have both provided in this booklet for you. Study guides are a key way to gain information but also to practice potential test questions for the test. This should be your primary form of studying as it is far faster to study using guides than the entire textbooks themselves. 


- Read this more than once. 
  * When it comes to studying, don’t read everything one time and call it there. Read it all multiple times. So, for example, if you don’t remember a section by heart, read it once, then go back to it. Each time you do so, you should retain more and more until the point that when your studying, you find yourself skipping as you just know it all by heart. Aim for this for all sections. 

- Study Breaks
  * The brain needs time to rest. You cannot study nonstop without a break and hope to retain all of the information. However, taking too many or too long of breaks can also make you run out of time. The best course of action is to find that perfect happy middle between breaks and studying, and for each and every student, that is something that must be found out on your own. 

## Chapter 2: Foundations

### 2.1. Governance

Throughout history, you will find a diverse set of government systems for peoples and nations both alike. Even in the eras in which “nations” were but instead “tribes,” there was always a “way to do things.” A system in place in which all would follow in thought, for the betterment of themselves, yes but also the whole of the group. 

From the earliest hunter-gathering societies to what we would deem to be “refined” governance in the form of democracy and all its forms, history shows paths that humans would gravitate toward, and this would result in how they would thus so be governed. 

Despite the passing of time and the prevailing view of the global order coming to view Democracy/Republicanism as the primary form of governance, it is best while going through your studies to try and come at things from an objective lens. This is not perfect, of course. All individuals will have their preferences; however, you must not allow that to blind you to the simple truth; all government styles and types have their advantages and disadvantages. We must also realize that while some ideologies and thus governments they spawned as such may be viewed as “repulsive, evil,” in fact, that history is the written accounts of the past. Not what we wished to happen. Only what did factually happen in our human history. 

The Hunting Gathering society’s primary advantage is that by living close to nature, humans are at their most “natural.” As such, biologically speaking, many humans will be psychologically the most at peace they have ever been. This is why at a very early level, women were considered just about equal to men in many ways. Society was broken down by biological lines, and none were viewed as higher or lower than the other. A major disadvantage of this society came in terms of scalability. The Hunting Gathering society was much like a tribe in many ways; as such, many viewed themselves as a family or extended family. The moment that “the other” came into existence outside of that, combat was only natural from then on. So thus so, from that weakness was born the next government type. 

Despotism: Always throughout history, you will find “the strong man.” The man who finds themselves powerful, above and most of all: Should be in charge. Naturally, as such, came the despotism government style. The idea that once would rule above all others. One major advantage of this system is that it’s fast.  On a whim, the supreme leader, with the mere snap of their fingers, could commit any action they liked. Whether righteous or otherwise. Which, in turn, would also bring us to its disadvantage. With the wrong kind of human being in this position, with the snap of their fingers, atrocities could be committed. Worst still, the position was always revolving based on who was the “strongest.”  And so, building on the previous two examples, came another government. One to try and remedy both situations. 

Monarchy/Dynasty Style Governments: Throughout all of Europe and Asia arose two types of governments that, while they had differences culturally when boiled down to their basic components, followed the same style. No longer was the “strongest” the leader; now, it was determined by “nobility” or “royalty.” Using religion as source of guidance and through the indoctrination of societies citizens/subjects were made to believe their leaders and eventually even their successors were not just powerful but also righteous in their rule. As such, the primary benefit to this government was the same as despotism, only without the con of it being a form of “revolving door” leadership. Even so, in practice, this was still the case behind closed doors, as elements of the government would constantly scheme to achieve the throne. Even so, it occurred at a less often rate than the rule of a “strong man” only style of government. The primary con, however, of this style of government for the leaders themselves came from the very pro that was supposed to keep them in power. Family. Oftentimes, arguments would emerge between the family, and relations would become strained. So, while in theory, leadership ascension should have been simple, in reality, behind the scenes, it tended not to be.

Republic: Another type of government system came in the form of something of an amalgamation of everything we had seen already. Building on the concept of Greek City States, they applied that instead now to a larger level. An “empire,” as it were. A central authority that would unite them all. In fact, today, we ourselves in the United States use a mix of both a Republic system but also a Democratic one alike. A major benefit to a Republic system is that while there are many bickering and arguments throughout history when humans are tried and tested, they come up with the best innovations. This was also the first time that each of the “city-states” were represented in a way in which they all had “theoretically” equal power in the form of the Roman Senate. A major con of this system is that it runs extremely slowly. By design, in many cases, a Republic is meant to be slow to ensure everyone gets their side represented or, at the very least, “the majority.” However, this means in times of crisis, should something need to be acted upon in a fast manner, a Republic might be found wanting, or at the very least, should that “executive” exist within The Republic, they may find their rule to be shaky should they act too fast even in times of a crisis. 

Communism: Born from the fruits of the industrial revolution, brought to light by  Karl Marx, Communism was born. The idea being that in order for an industrial society to prosper, it should and must be The Proletariat (The Laboring Class) who seize and maintain the means of production in the country. Designed as an economic system in which labor would be done, this would, however, morph and evolve into the idea that, instead, this must always be the case at all levels. As such, this economic system would, in turn, eventually morph into a government system in which a command economy was controlled by a leader. A pro of this is that the majority of a country would be linked in terms of “class.” The overwhelming majority would all be laborers of some kind. The con, however, is that, in truth, The Elite would still exist. They would be those who planned the economy and made the governmental decisions. Opponents of this system dare say: That communism solved the issue of poverty by making “everyone” poor, rather than only some. 

Fascism: Fascism takes that concept of “The Other” all the way back from Hunting Gathering Days and cranks it up to its most extreme level. Fascism is a government in which a supreme leader is usually in such a position through not only strength and power but also coming with it comes what they call “racial purity.” This, it argues, creates strong soldiers and a true and ultimate “meritocratic” society but also an entire species. In history, there have only been two examples of this type of society having great power. Those societies were Italy, and it’s more infamous: Nazi Germany of World War II. A pro of this type of system is that, indeed, it does get “the results” that it wishes to achieve. “Strength” through any means. However, the cons are many. For to achieve such things come racial genocide, the genocide of children who are “impure” by their standards, and those standards can be anything. The amount of death, pain, and suffering that must occur in such a system is, without a doubt, fascism's greatest con. 

Democracy: A rather new invention in which most societies in our modern era have tried to adopt in some form. However, in truth, no society has successfully adopted a pure form of Democracy, or a “Direct Democracy” as it’s come to be called. For example, our own United States is a hybrid of both the Republic system and the Democratic system alike. Democracy, in essence, is the belief that for every living soul, they shall have a voice. One vote. This turns power instead of a might versus right battle that occurs with every other system, instead, into a battle of the mind. A battle of arguments. Power is achieved, in essence, from convincing people rather than pointing weapons at them. A major pro to this is that under a Democracy comes great power in each and every one of its citizens. For its leader and many decisions as such are chosen by that of the citizens themselves within that society. A major con of this, like the Republic, is the speed at which it operates but at an even greater level. It also, however, comes in the form of the “tyranny of the majority.” For in a true direct democracy, any issue is on the table to be voted on by the people. Any and each will come down to a vote, and the majority thinking idea will come out on top. That doesn’t always mean “the morally right” idea. 

### 2.2.	Geographic Orientation

Geography, while it may seem at first unimportant in the grand scheme of things, is actually critical to all cultures and nations. Does your nation sit in a desert? You might have water issues, and so issues may arise with the water supply that requires far more advanced solutions. Giant bodies of water separate you, and where do you want to go? Is this the end? Heavens, no, let’s make a boat! Such as the Chinese “Junk,” as it was called.

One such example of the key to geography is how humanity was even able to get to the Americas. Using The Bering Land Bridge from Asia, it is thought that walking across it led those in Asia to the Americas today, which resulted in the Native Americans as we know them today living here among many other different groups of people all across the two Americas. This is a key example of the role of geography, for today, The Bering Land Bridge is long since gone. In fact, in the ancient past, it wouldn’t even have been called a “land bridge”; it would have just been a part of the land.

Tectonic plates across the world slowly shift and change, moving land masses across the world. It is thought, in fact, that once we were a supercontinent of everything together. Slowly, however, that began to break apart, which resulted in many of the different human cultures being split up. 

As we move along in this guide, always take some time to immerse yourself in the geography. It doesn’t have to be long but truly let your brain comprehend the sheer differences between your household compared to the culture you are trying to study. It will make things far easier as you go along. 

### 2.3. 	Cultural Developments and Interactions

From even the earliest times, culture as we know it, even in today's modern era, has always existed in some form or another. From pottery, as we would now call: Art, to forms of songs played on instruments long since out of use, humanity has always been constantly interacting with one another. 

A culture is a set of people that follow a certain lifestyle and, historically, in a context of not having our world wide web yet, would tend to be close together. In modern times, this tended to culminate in the form of a nation, but it started smaller in the forms of “tribes” or even just single families and single huts. 

A society comes to “culture:” in two different forms. One form is independent innovation or rather things that they came up with on their own and started mostly with them. Whereas the other form is called “diffusion.” This form comes from things borrowed from (or even taken in the instance of conquered tribes and nations) other cultures and mixed into their own. 

One of the most important cultural aspects of any given culture is its language and written word. For without their written word, of course, would come not any history. Would come not even this very guide that you are reading. 

Many cultures as well came up with their own belief systems known as: “Religion.” Many of them still find their practices today as well. Religion is “the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.”. Of each religion would come a personal history of its people that have practiced it. Below shall be a summary of key aspects of said religions. Religions have two forms of belief systems. Polytheistic, which means that they believe in multiple gods, and then Monotheistic, which means that they believe in only one god. 

Hinduism: Previously known as “Vedism,” Hinduism was its coming successor. It teaches that all beings have a soul that wishes to become reunited with a greater and ultimate “World Soul.” Vedism brought into place a caste system, believing that all living souls are reincarnated after death in the form of the birth of another being. Thus so, they believed that should you die justly, and as a good follower, you would be promoted in the caste higher in ranking. They called this: Dharma (Karma as we call it). The most righteous of which attaining the title of “The Elite” and those of evil deeds being born as “The Untouchables.” Hinduism is a polytheistic religion believing in several gods. Their most notable: are Brahma, The World Soul, and personified as a male. Vishnu The Preserver, Shiva The Destroyer, and their great goddess: Shakti. 

Buddhism: Created in a great schism from Hinduism, Buddhism was created by a man known as “The Buddha.” Once one of the “Elites,” The Buddha saw the suffering of other humans and would come to develop a new set of teachings in a separate religion entirely. Of that come the core Four Noble Truths: “The truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering.” In other words: Suffering exists; it has a cause, it has an end, and it has a cause to bring its end. Like its predecessor, Hinduism, Buddhism believes in the concepts of Karma and Reincarnation. However, they instead argue against the caste system. Believing that any and all can eventually be reunited with the World Soul through accepting and acting upon the Four Noble Truths. 

Confucianism: Created by a man named Confucius as an act of rebellion due to strife of the time period, in his retirement, he came up with a set of beliefs that found followers in China’s early periods. Confucianism cared little for Chinese gods at the time and focused more on ethical and just actions in the living world. The core belief of the religion was that benevolent ruling from above would result in good behavior from those below. Creating a social and perfect harmony for the whole of society. Order and hierarchy are critical, and the good of the many always comes before the good of the one. The idea is that should a ruler rule justly, then the people ruled are obligated to be ruled and behave well under the said ruling. It also set that all of society was one giant family and that it should essentially always respect its elders. On Confucius's death, these teachings were all found in the religion's “holy text” known as the “Analects.” 

Daoism: Daoists seek to achieve harmony with what they call: The Dao, which is their word for: “The Way/Path.” An invisible but irresistible force that governs the whole of the entire universe. Whereas Confucianism is about Order, Daoism could be described as more “chaotic.” They reject the idea of rationality and instead seek more nonlogical means of understanding. The most famous Daoist symbol is that of the Yin and Yang. It embraced things like fortune telling and alchemy, among even the sciences.

Zoroastrianism: Considered to be the first “Monotheistic” religion. Zoroastrians believed that those deemed worthy would go on to assist their god, Ahura Mazda, in his work as the creator of all things good against its ancient evil Ahriman. The religion was thought to have originated in Iran and became a major political force in 500’s B.C.E when Darius the Great used the religion to justify his rule as the supreme and ultimate king of his nation. 

Judaism: The Hebrew people came from that Monotheistic belief structure. Like the Zoroastrians, they believed in a single god. The primary belief system of the Jewish faith is that through the acts advised within The Torah shall come the ascension into the promised land. Those who fail to do so shall be condemned to Hell. 

Christianity: Take all that was said about Judaism and now instead add in Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus taught that caring and compassion were more important than Rabbi (Priests) and societal customs. Christianity was very popular amongst the common folk due to its easy-to-follow and understood beliefs as well as its more “populist” message. However, these teachings would anger the local Jewish government in which the religion came into its existence, and Jesus would end up crucified on the cross. Its follower's believed that he was resurrected and that this man was the son of God. 

Islam: The youngest of the three major monotheistic religions, Islam follows many of the same teachings as Judaism, but instead of Jesus being their primary figure, the Prophet Muhammad instead was their leader.  While meditating in 610 C.E, Muhammad stated that he had heard the words and seen a vision from the Archangel Jibril. Giving him the word of Allah (God). They believe in the Five Pillars of Faith. 

### 2.4.	Technology and Innovations

From the discovery of fire to our modern inventions today, humanity has always been an ever-evolving and ever-growing species. Some of the most notable would be that of metallurgy, which allowed for the transition from basic stone tools to more advanced metal tools that were even used in the form of swords and various other medieval weapons in our C.E timeline. These came into major use in 4000 – 3000 B.C.E. Think of all those millions of years as such in which we as humans had to use nothing more than stone! Iron came at around 1200 B.C.E whereas before; most tools were of bronze make. 

Not only was such an invention for weapons of war, but. Such tools could also be used for farming methods and methods in general, just to make humanity's life more comfortable. The Wheel, an infamous invention, was of great assistance with this as well. 

When looking to the Vikings in their era of time, you can see the true benefit of seafaring at work. Having to travel sea to sea in order to find the various lands which they would conquer and plunder.

The discovery and invention of mathematics, engineering, and improved medicinal techniques improved the average quality and lifespan of humanity as a whole as well. 

While the Printing Press technology was a major innovation, it is must newer than its predecessor. The Woodblock Printing technology came into use in China in the 200s C.E. 

Where humanity found needs and found struggles, humanity would always find a way to improve. This, if nowhere else, can best and always be seen in the things that we as humans have created throughout the many years that we have existed. 

### 2.5.	Economic Systems

Economic systems are as varied and evolving as humanity itself. In the millions of years that humanity has been on earth, so long as there has been something another human can do/obtain that another cannot easily or at speed needed, trade has existed. From the bartering systems of old to the more modern systems of now, economic systems have always existed in some form or another. 

Before 1200 C.E, was Pre Industrial society which tended to be mostly agricultural, pastoral, hunting, and forging style trading. These types of trading eventually led to marketplaces that served as hubs of expected goods for “paying” customers. From these marketplaces, eventually, would come trade routes such as the famous “Silk Road,” which in turn would begin the cultural exchange between the different groups, which led to the spread of religions and various other ideas. 

Coins were developed and invented in the Middle East around the years of 600-500 B.C.E, and paper money/bank notes were invented in China in the years of 600-1100 C.E., Becoming a more currency-based economy rather than the pure bartering system that had been used up to this point. Shortly as well within that time period also came the idea of banking and credit, which inspired more trust-based economics. 

The types of economic systems we have seen through history and that are of note are as follows below:

Bartering: The trade of a good for another good or a set number of varied goods or multiple of one types of good. There is very little division of labor or specialization.

Command Economy: An economy that is dominated and controlled by some form of centralized authority, usually the government or ruler. They plan out the nature of how the economy works and the divisions of labor within it. They react slowly to people's wants and needs traditionally and, as such, tend not to do well in many of the long terms. The most famous form of named distinct Command Economy is Communism. 

Market Economy: Market economies are based on the idea of Free Markets. The idea is that very little government interference will result in markets designed more toward what the actual citizens/economic buyers in the nation want rather than what the government wants per se. The ultimate law comes in the form of Supply and Demand. The idea of the demand for a product and the supply of said product dictate the price and quantity in which the product is sold/moved to different communities and individuals. The most famous named distinct Market Economy is Capitalism. A downside of this system is that it tends to result in certain individuals amassing a great deal of wealth and then, by extension, power. It also gears a market toward what is desired rather than what is “needed,” as the state would define it. 

Mixed System: Most modern nations today use a Mixed System. A Mixed System is a combination of both Market and Command Economies. An example of a mixed system is a heavily regulated market economy or even a middle/semi-regulated economy. As such, almost every economy in the entire world is a Mixed System at this point in time. The idea is by mixing the best of both and cutting out the worst; only the best can come from it. Others would argue otherwise. 

### 2.6.	Social Interactions and Organizations

In our modern-day life, social structures are things we as humans grasp in seconds and give little thought to. The reason being that we are living it day to day at that moment. We know what is and what is not socially acceptable. For the sake of history, however, and going back in time to gleam the gems of the past, we must understand the past social structures and organizations; we much analyze them, and to do so can take some time to achieve. 

The key things to note are as follows: Who exercises power in this structure? Why? That should lead to what a society values. Next, how is labor organized? Do people pick their jobs like in modern capitalist society, or are they thrust into one by the edict of their government? Are they prosperous, or are they in hard times? What role does their social class or gender have in this society? How are they viewed as such? Do they view certain skin colors as different/superior? Inferior? What religion is the dominant one? Is there even one? All these questions and more will give you a window, a lens if you will, into the daily life of how people operate and why they do so. 

Take early humans. Most tended to go into gender roles as, to them, it was biologically natural. No one yet truly knew how to grow food, so women would forage, and men would hunt. That was the way of things, for the most part, and how most societies supported each other. A simple culture led to simple but immense issues. No food this week? You starved. That was it. 

Social classes tended to exist in all societies, even hunting-gathering ones, but they became more complex and varied as time went on in human civilization. One of such changes was the concept of the slave and so also began the slave trade. The idea was that another human being could be subjugated for any reason to do the bidding of whomever their master was. 

How did the society view “The Other,” as in those from outside the nation or those whom they viewed as ethnically different? The Fascists thought such things should be removed by the most disturbing of methods. Other cultures embraced their diversity. Though, that mostly hasn’t happened until our modern era. Still, some levels of comfort came to certain groups that didn’t exist elsewhere. For example, in Islam, it is said that women, at the time of the founding of the religion, had a more equalized lifestyle as opposed to other religions. The question then becomes, why? Was it by design, or was it by sheer coincidence? Circumstances of the times, perhaps? 

### 2.7.	Humans and the Environment

The tale of the environment and humans is an interesting one. For in truth, we want from being dictated by the environment to living with it and then conquering it in our modern times. To the point now where we can influence the environment to such a degree that we can cause what now has come to be known as “Man Made Natural Disasters.” 

While during the time of our human hunting-gathering eras, the environmental effects were still there, the unintended consequences of those actions were minor compared to the consequences of today. 

One such consequence that was done in our early history was the result of the domestication of animals. By choosing artificially the animals which we preferred, we caused them to both thrive but to also evolve in such a way to benefit us. Take, for example, The Dog. Man’s best friend, as they call them. 

Later, as our methods of resource extraction became more intense, so too did the damage to the general area as well. Our biggest damages to the world came in the form of species extinction, deforestation, and erosion. 

# Part Two: c. 1200 to c. 1450

## Chapter 3: The Global Tapestry (8-10% of the test)

### 3.1 Developments in East Asia

During this time period in East Asia, the main thing to truly focus on and talk about was the dominance of the powerhouse that was China’s Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty was a massive and powerful Chinese dynasty (Empire). 

Confucianism had become the dominant ideology of this time period in the dynasty and with it came all of its beliefs. In this time period, not only was the Song Dynasty the most powerful East Asian nation, it could have been considered the strongest nation on the whole of the planet in terms of power, influence, size, trade, and military. 

So vast and powerful was its empire that it began to spread to every neighboring region, dominating all of East Asia. One of those ideologies to spread from Confucianism was gender roles. Respect for women but the idea that they were to also have deference. 

Citizenship in this Dynasty was determined by The Civil Services Exam. The Civil Services Exam essentially would determine your future and success within the Song Dynasty, as through the Civil Services Exam, you could go from being an average citizen to becoming a government official. This led to an interesting change of the status quo in which government power was now led by the educated and those who passed the exam, rather than by military might dominating all positions of leadership. The primary thing that you needed for The Civil Services Exam was a heavy mastery of Confucianism texts and knowledge. This would tend to lead to a higher ranking in the Song Dynasty. As time went on, the exam would become more and more open as it was seen as such a path forward to success. 

Economic production increased drastically in this time period, and a key economic resource was textiles and silk.  

Environmentally Champa rice was created, and their plants spread throughout all of East Asia for the economic purposes of the Song Dynasty. It kept the citizens of the Dynasty well fed, so much so that they could even afford to export it elsewhere for trade.

### 3.2 Developments in Dar al-Islam

Dar-Al-Islam, or “The World of Islam,” covers not only the middle east but also parts of Africa. However, in truth, Islam cares not for things such as national borders and views its people instead as more of a global body. They call this the “Ummah.” An Arabic word for “Community” is our best English conversion. Islam will be a present factor in all remaining chapters, but for this chapter, the primary focus is the greater whole of Islam itself.

Islam spread greatly in this time period through military conquest but also through Sufi Mystics bringing in converts to the religion. They would grant a jizya or rather “tax” to maintain their non-Islamic religion. 

Intellectually the Islamic world was very scholarly and focused on innovation. Innovations were preserved well in various different documented texts, and they are well known to have examined and gleamed their own intellectual forms of philosophers from examining the ancient Greek and roman texts of old. This knowledge would then transfer around the world as the Ummah would migrate, settle or go on various different trade routes across the world. 

### 3.3 Developments in South and Southeast Asia

The region consisting of India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The region saw a triangle of religions leading to many diverse cultures developing within it that didn’t always get along well. This triangle was that of Hinduism, which was the dominant faction. Buddhism, which was bred as a form of an offshoot of Hinduism, as such putting the two in strife with one another in some ways. And lastly, Sufi Islam. 

Sufi Islam and Hinduism could be called the more “Mystical” aspect of the religions and ideologies followed in these regions. At the same time, Buddhism was a mostly “monastic” religion compared to the other two. 

The Khmer Empire, located in present-day Cambodia, was one such Hunduist nation. Historically famous for its buildings to Vishnu and Shiva, it was one of the most powerful nations in the region and was a strong stronghold for the Hinduist religion. 

### 3.4 State Building in the Americas

State building in the Americas primarily consisted of the regions of North America, Mesoamerica, and the Andes Mountains. The beginning of the decline of the Mayan City States had begun, and they had begun to give way to the new rising Aztec Empire. The Inca Empire was also well at hand in development in the Andes Mountains. 

Most cultures in the region were polytheistic, whereas economically, they had no singular Americanized network connecting the different regions together. Instead, most trading and economic affairs were handled at the local and regional levels. 

The Mayan City States deferred from the Greek example as, unlike The Greeks, The Mayans had zero “Federal” government in their history. In other words, they not once in recorded history all banded together united under a single king. Instead, each Mayan City State was ruled over by its own priests and kings, which dictated how the City State would run. 

That’s not to say that they weren’t on the same side or that they were independent. In history, The Mayan Civilization is often referred to as “The Mayan Empire” for a reason. For in truth, while each City State was independent, many had tribute obligations to one another in exchange for security, alliances, and good balanced and safely maintained trade.

### 3.5 State Building in Africa 

Islam spread heavily throughout Africa and tended to be adopted by the elites and then brought downstream to its citizens. These elites wanted to be part of something “higher” and better as well as united, and so they turned to “Dar al-Islam” as this greater world to turn to. They also tried to bring prosperity to their own people through the use and belief in a new god. The god of Islam. Allah. Islam allowed rulers to keep most of their existing practices already in place with some very slow shifts into the more Islam style of rule. 

Something done in Africa was the use of the jizya tax, and this is where it was mostly seen. While other monotheistic style religions were allowed to pay the poll tax, any polytheistic religions (which Africa was heavily pre-Islam) were offered the option of conversion or death. 

Through Islam came the intellectual transfer into Africa of the very technologies that Islamic groups are credited with making, such as mathematics. This many came from the economic trade routes and the Islamic people traveling on them. They brought with them many technologies such as leatherworking and even more advanced metal working as well as the very religion of Islam itself. 

Economically Africa in this time period is not at all the stereotypical view of Africa in our modern times. It was heavily connected economically via various land trade routes and even oceanic routes that were left outside of the continent. One legendary economic powerhouse was the nation of Great Zimbabwe which was one of the top trading nations of the time period.

While Islam played a deep and expanding role in Africa, it should very much be noted that it wasn’t the only religion despite being the most dominant. In fact, the whole of West Africa tended to practice other religions as their dominant as opposed to Islam. West Africa, however, had a very good and peaceful relationship with Islam. To the point in this time period, even the polytheistic religions appeared to be safe from any form of issues. Christianity was also huge in Ethiopia, which even considered itself a “Christian Empire” culturally within Africa. 

### 3.6 Developments in Europe

The story of Europe in this time period is one of division and fragmentation at almost every level and aspect of life. From political to religious, both Europe was heavily divided and extremely diverse in their nations. 

The dominant religion of Europe became Christianity. It was not the only religion, and there were indeed others, but it was the major and dominant one in the religion. 

Religiously, the Christian Religion had been split in half. Becoming that of Orthodox Christianity and Catholicism. The primary difference being in that Catholics looked to their Popes as being below God, yes, but infallible and essentially unquestionable. For lack of any other word, like Gods themselves. At the same time, The Orthodox sect believed that even their Patriarchs were not beyond questioning or scrutiny. This division was so intense that even conflict broke out about it and has even to this very day.


Nationally, Europe has no single “Great Empire” to rule them all. It’s entirely divided and fragmented at every level, with all nations fighting for power and land. They are even divided into local politics and views of leadership within those local areas. 

Economically most of Europe is based on agricultural production and trading. Labor was devised into two different group types. The first is “Free Labor,” which essentially means people are growing/creating their own things for themselves or selling to others. In other words, the only way that we do things now in modern America for the most part. In contrast, the alternative option was called “coerced labor,” which at this time went by the name of Serfdom. 

Serfdom was essentially labor that was forced and not compensated in the form of a wage. Serfdom was the idea that an individual and their whole family line were essentially “indebted” to a Lord, usually of a plot of land or several. As such, they themselves and their children would be working for this Lord as a means to “pay off their debts,” only traditionally, those debts never tended to actually be paid off. Many compare it to slavery, and it’s very close. However, slavery was far more overt and extreme. A slave was seen as “property,” whereas a Serf was still seen as a worker. Just indebted work. 

### 3.7 Comparisons in the Period

Taking all that you have no learned into account, it is a good place to use this time to recap the major comparisons of this world, and you will find there are three key takeaways from it.

Islam: Islamic rule was heavily unified and prosperous as it settled into regions like Africa. Since it was easily accepted by local population leaders firsthand and then slowly trickled down into the people through the use of force and laws, they made many advancements and developed many things. In every aspect, Islam viewed itself as unified, and this can be seen in how they behaved amongst one another. “Dar al-Islam” was truly taken to its literal in many instances in how they ruled and what they did during said rule during this time period. They existed nearly everywhere and were constantly evolving, changing, and thriving where they were found. 

The Free: South/Southeast Asia and The Americas were heavily independent of all other aspects of the world but, above all, were free. While things would get a bit chaotic due to all the religions in South/South East Asia, for example, most groups were allowed to practice this religion as they wished. Whereas in The Americas, in The Mayan system, for example, they were allowed freedom based upon city-states and their rules and laws within them. Freedom of religion in one area and more freedom of laws and governments in another. 

The Empire: East Asia is heavily dominated by a great Empire known as a Dynasty in their cultural use of the word. That being The Song Dynasty. They are a military, economic, technological, and even intellectual powerhouse that has very few rivals. 

The Divided: Europe is scattered, fragmented, and in many ways in turmoil due to the fighting and divisions in religions, political power, and even regal power. Everywhere you go in Europe, everything is divided. Even in the most basic labor sense, there are different classes, and thus so, divisions in Europe between those allowed “free labor” and Coerced Labor. While diversity isn’t always a bad thing, in many ways, this manifested badly in Europe to create great chaos that resulted in many deaths and much damage across the region. Yet despite all of this, the one thing that Europe was not divided in on the world stage was being alone region-wise. Europe is, without a doubt, the most divided in this time period.
