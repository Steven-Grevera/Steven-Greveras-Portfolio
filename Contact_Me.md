## **This is a page in which I would proceed to provide my email and phone number. However, with advisement from our college professor, I have opted to omit this information and am noting that should this has been a real thing presented to employeers, I would have actually presented those things here.** 

# Said Professors Words: 

### "Optional: resume, samples of other work you've done, and maybe a "Contact Me" form (rather than an email address that could be picked up by spammers) Never post your home address or cell phone number on a public site. If you post your resume, delete this information from the file before you upload it."
