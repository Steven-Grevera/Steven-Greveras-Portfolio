# A Darker Time, A Darker Vader

Something Star Wars has always done well over the many decades in which it has existed is using existing characters effectively. Darth Vader, both on the big screen and in comic lore is a cultural icon to the point of a mythological presence. Yet, in truth, he was a product of his time both in-universe and in our very own. The tragedy of Vader was that he was thought to be a resounding hero that would save the galaxy. Anakin Skywalker. Only, in the end, he would bring in a dark age for the whole of the galaxy. He has a last-minute redemption arc in the name of his son and so the tale goes of Vader. 

With as large as Vader had become in our world and in the star wars universe, it would come as no surprise that they would try and replicate it again (as they have also done with the newest movies with Kylo Ren). Only, unlike Kylo Ren, this iteration, in-universe could be considered that of a “prototype” in the time streams. A shadow cast from the future of what would soon come, in a much darker time of a much darker character. Enter: Darth Malgus. 

Darth Malgus, a human male born under the old name: Veradun, unlike Anakin, started off in a dark place. In the age of The Old Republic, slavery was as rampant as in the age of Vader. Malgus had killed one of their slaves, revealing his brutality but also his affinity for the dark side. He would then be raised in a Sith Academy where he would rise to the rank of a powerful Sith Imperial Commander. 

Malgus would lead many campaigns against The Old Republic suffering both major defeats and major victories both. One such major victory was the recapturing of Korriban, where he would experience a force vision in which he saw that he would end The Republic himself, forever. However, one such major defeat was the battle of Alderaan, where his nemesis, Satele Shan, would mortally wound him. Malgus would be forced to wear a respirator for the rest of his life after this battle, much like Vader. 

Such was the nature of the war, it was brutal and it was bloody. Amid all this chaos, fate, strangely, would have him fall in love with another slave whom he would one day marry. Her name was Eleena Daru. Slave, in title only. In truth, she enjoyed a great deal of freedom under their marriage and only kept the title as in Sith society such a thing would become a major problem for them. More on that later. 

Malgus, as an Imperial Sith Commander, served under the period's Sith Emperor, a parrel in many ways to our own infamous Darth Vader. In a battle for a major planet, the Republic planet of Ord Radama was on the verge of being taken but The Empire refused to resupply Malgus and his forces and so, a ship nearby, housing a close friend of his, was struck down, feeling in the force they had fallen. This friend was Venemal. 

So came his moment. The pain of the loss of Venemal made him unleash a blood-curdling scream, which destroyed the glass of his own ship currently on but also destroyed an entire wave of spacecraft that had been near the ship. Doing this, with a scream alone. He had cemented truly just how powerful he was. Feeling betrayed by The Empire, their war would continue but the moment would be burned into his mind forever and this would only worsen. 

Malgus in the future would lead an invasion of the Old Republic Capital planet of Coruscant. There, Malgus, in much the same way Anakin did in the films, led an assault (second in command by rank technically but the real powerhouse of the assault) on the Jedi Temple. It would swiftly fall and burn before his might. They then would sack and destroy The Republic Senate and even its Supreme Chancellor. Malgus had defeated The Jedi and he had done so for The Sith. 

The leadership of The Sith, however, had other plans. The Sith had instead of destroying the planet wholly, decided instead to conquer it for the purpose of using it as leverage in negotiations of a Republic peace treaty. Malgus, enraged, charged into leadership and demanded to know of what was happening. Instead, he was embarrassed before them all. His love life was exposed to those all present in the room and used as a means of distracting him. Leadership had found her injured in the chaos of the battle and refused her treatment. She was now in a hospital. Enraged, he stormed off to find her. She had survived there when she was found but even so, the stain was forever upon him. 

And so comes the darker side of this darker time. Malgus made a choice and committed an action that Vader never would have intentionally. Malgus murdered his lover, his wife, to remove any and all weakness that could be exploited by those who he now felt intense hate. The Jedi Academy was turned into a Sith academy and so darkness fell upon the plane and deeper so within Malgus himself. 

Malgus, like Vader to The Jedi as Anakin, would now betray The Sith. Feeling immense rage for all that had happened to him, Malgus, seeing a peace treaty signed, would raise an army of droids for his own personal use. He would also raise an army in which he led, with the belief that it should now be he who leads The Empire. He would recruit mercenaries of primarily alien races and other Sith that would follow him and so he had now become an intense third force in the galaxy. 

Malgus would lead an effective assault against The Galaxy but in the end, would seemingly be killed via pulse grenades, sent off to die in the vacuum of space. For long a time, this seemed to be the end of his story, losing a critical battle much how Vader lost to Obi-Wan. 

But this was not the end. Malgus would return and would do battle once more with the Republic. He would see a vision of his defeat at their hands but refused to let this come to pass. In the end, however, he would be captured and imprisoned and for most part in the lore, continues to be so as of this time. 

Malgus was such a powerful influence and warrior, that in many ways, he was Darth Sidious's inspiration for Vader. So much so, in fact, that Sidious had found long ago Malgus's journal of his war stories and had Vader study him and them in total. Vader even sees his own similarities with Malgus himself. 

So to recap now. Visions like Anakin (Vader). A love life that ended in the literal loss of life, not just a “breakup”. Respirators which give them their iconic and infamous heavy breathing. Betrayal of the side they fought for to form their own side (though in Vaders case bringing back a long since thought dead side) and both would serve as brutal warriors for an Emperor of The Sith. 

The differences, of course, come in the nature of the wartime period. Malgus was far more brutal than even Vader, killing his own wife and betraying those among him many a time. So much so in fact, he would become a major inspiration for Sidious's own “Rule of Two” for The Sith. Despite these differences, they are so alike, it’s no wonder that Sidious would have Vader learn of Malgus ways and every being. Even amongst The Sith, Malgus stands as once of the strongest Sith to have ever existed, even besting Revan in combat, so the legends say.
